- How does the NIH use the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs?
- NIH uses these programs to move products into the hands of people who need them
  across the public health spectrum. Through the SBIR and STTR programs, NIH supports
  the research and development need to commercialize new innovations. By encouraging
  commercialization on the part of its recipient community, SBIR and STTR programs
  also serve the larger government-wide goal of promoting small business sustainability.
  With some notable exceptions, NIH is typically not the end purchaser of products
  developed through its SBIR and STTR programs.
- What are the differences between the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and
  Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs?
- Although the scope of the work is the same for SBIR and STTR programs, there are
  critical differences that can be broken down into two main categories. The first
  category relates to the role played by a research partner on the award. SBIR permits
  and encourages research partnerships. However, STTR requires that the applicant
  small business formally collaborate with a non-profit research institution. As a
  result, SBIR and STTR projects have different work distribution requirements which
  are described in detail. The second category relates to the employment status of
  the project lead, known as a Principal Investigator (PI), at the time of the award
  and during the entire project period. For the SBIR program, the PI must be primarily
  employed by the small business. For the STTR program, the PI can be primarily employed
  by either the small business or the partner research institution. Further information
  related to these programs can be found within the NIH Grants Policy Statement Chapter
  18.5, which discusses the SBIR/STTR program requirements and differences. SBIR and
  STTR awards are always made to the small business.
- Can a small business switch between the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  program or the Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs after
  receiving Phase I funding?
- Yes. NIH SBIR and STTR applicants may switch programs at Phase II or Phase IIB to
  any active and open NIH SBIR or STTR solicitation. This means that:. This is outlined
  in the NIH Grants Policy Statement Chapter 18.5, discussing SBIR/STTR awards. Applicants
  must follow all of the policies and requirements included in the program/solicitation
  for which they are applying. Applicants are strongly advised to discuss this option
  with their assigned Program Official (PO) well in advance of any due date. .
- Can a small business submit a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small
  Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II application without having
  received a Phase I award?
- In the SBIR program, applicants can submit a Direct-to-Phase II application. Direct-to-Phase
  II awards are not available in the STTR program and are also not available from
  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration
  (FDA), or the Administration for Community Living (ACL) SBIR programs. Applicants
  are strongly advised to discuss the Direct-to-Phase II SBIR mechanism with a Small
  Business Program Manager well in advance of any due date.
- What is the difference between a Fast-Track and Direct-to-Phase II?
- "Fast-Trackapplications(available to SBIR and STTR)includeboth Phase I and Phase\
  \ IIinformationin one application. As a result, both phasesare submittedandundergo\
  \ review at the same time. A significant benefit ofthe NIH Fast-Track mechanismis\
  \ that itcan reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. Direct-to-Phase\
  \ II applications are only available through the SBIR program and allow small businesses\
  \ to submit a Phase II without having received a Phase I award. The primary difference\
  \ between Fast-Track and Direct-to-Phase II applications is the timing of the Phase\
  \ I project work. In a Fast-Track, the Phase I work is the first component of the\
  \ project period. Direct-to-Phase II bypasses this step; instead, Direct to Phase\
  \ II applicants must have performed the equivalent of Phase I research prior to\
  \ submission of the application. Further details about the NIH Fast-Track Application\
  \ can be found in the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 18.5.1 \u201CNIH Fast-Track\
  \ Application Process.\u201D. Applicants are strongly advised to discuss options\
  \ with a Small Business Program Manager well in advance of any due date."
- Where can I find out what projects in my research topic area have been supported
  by NIH?
- TheResearch Portfolio Online Reporting Tool(RePORT) provides access to reports,
  data, and analyses of NIH research activities, including the results of NIH-supported
  research. To find similar funded projects that are similar, briefly describe the
  intended research in the text box on the NIH Matchmaker page within RePORT (see
  instructional video) and click on the "Similar Projects" tab. In addition to showing
  similar projects funded by NIH, the Matchmaker tool will help identify the NIH Institute
  or Center most likely to fund the project. This can also help identify the most
  appropriate Small Business Program Managers to contact about the project idea. .
- What resources are available for help with applications (e.g., sample applications
  or instructions on how to fill out the application form)?
- Find Sample Phase I and Phase II Applications. Comprehensive instructions on how
  to fill out the SF424 small business application forms are a great resource. In
  addition, the NIH website provides an annotated form set, which walks applicants
  through each entry on the SF424 application forms. .
- How can I find information on the scientific priorities and small business Program
  Official (PO) contacts of the NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) to discuss my project?
- It is recommended that applicants read through the Program Descriptions for NIH
  ICs to guide them to the ICs that fund research related to their project. Please
  refer to Finding the Right Fit for Your Research for additional information. Contact
  a Small Business Program Manager if you require further assistance.
- What opportunities are available to apply for Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs?
- Small businesses can apply to the SBIR and STTR programs through omnibus (parent)
  FOAs or targeted FOAs. Current funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) are posted
  on the SEED website and the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts regularly.
- What is the difference between the omnibus (parent) funding opportunity announcement
  (FOA) and a target or special funding opportunity announcement (FOA)?
- A parent FOA allows an applicant to submit a project for consideration by any of
  the NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration
  Institutes and Centers (ICs) that participate. Targeted FOAs are periodically issued
  by one or more Institutes or Centers and focus on specific areas of science priorities.
  Special nuances and/or requirements (i.e., amount of funds that may be requested
  and review criteria) may be imposed under these announcements. In either case, the
  project must fall within the mission of the participating ICs.
- What are the page limit requirements for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) applications?
- The page limits are included in the SF424 SBIR/STTR (R&R) Application Guide. Briefly:.
- How does a small business submit a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or
  Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) application?
- NIH recommends using the Application Submission System & Interface for Submission
  Tracking (ASSIST) web portal to prepare and submit applications electronically to
  NIH. Prior to using ASSIST, applicants should identify a Funding Opportunity Announcement
  (FOA) to which they'd like to apply. Please review the ASSIST User Guide for more
  information.
- When can a small business submit a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or
  Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) application?
- Application submission due dates and related policies are posted on the NIH Grants
  website as well as on the application process page. The standard due dates are September
  5, January 5, and April 5 for applications submitted in response to an omnibus (parent)
  SBIR or STTR funding opportunity announcement. If an application submission due
  date falls on a weekend or holiday, the due date is the following business day.
  Submission dates for targeted or special funding opportunity announcements vary
  so applicants must check the announcement for its specific date(s).
- Is it possible to submit an application after the due date?
- "Generally, late applications are not accepted. However, if an application is submitted\
  \ after the required date, it must be accompanied by a cover letter explaining the\
  \ reasons for the delay. Late applications are handled on a case-by-case basis,\
  \ considering the length of delay and the reasons provided. Contacting the Center\
  \ for Scientific Review Division of Receipt and Referral staff, review staff, or\
  \ Institute or Center program staff in advance will not result in permission to\
  \ submit a late application. Read about NIH\u2019s late policy."
- Can Phase I or Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) awardees from other federal organizations apply
  for NIH Phase II or Phase IIB grants?
- Yes. A small business that received a SBIR or STTR Phase I or Phase II award from
  another federal organization may submit a follow-on Phase II or Phase IIB to the
  NIH. However, the applicant must receive approval from the Program Official (PO)
  to do so ahead of time. Not all Institutes and Centers will accept Phase IIB applications
  following Phase II awards from other federal agencies. It is imperative that the
  small business and the PO have a conversation before the application is submitted.
- How long does a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology
  Transfer Research (STTR) program recipient have to submit the Phase II application
  after the Phase I project ends?
- The recipient may submit a Phase II application either before or after expiration
  of the Phase I budget period. A Phase I recipient must submit a Phase II application
  within the first six application submission due dates following the expiration of
  the Phase I budget period. To request an exception, the applicant must seek approval
  from the Phase I Program Official (PO). If the PO is willing to receive an application,
  a waiver may be granted.
- What registrations are required for submission to a Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) program?
- Applicant organizations must complete and maintain five registrations as described
  in the NIH Grants and Funding website to be eligible to apply for or receive an
  award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted.
  Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration
  process as soon as possible.
- Is the System for Award Management (SAM) the only registration that's annual?
- Yes. SAM is the only registration that must be renewed annually, which requires
  the small business to log in to SAM and renew the registration. The other registrations
  are one time and should only be updated if information changes, such as if the small
  business moves or changes address.
- If the Principal Investigator (PI) is employed by a university and owns a small
  business, are two distinct eRA Commons names required for each entity?
- No. A PI does not need distinct eRA Commons names for each entity. PIs only need
  one eRA Commons PI account, which will follow them throughout their career. However,
  a small business official at the small business must have a separate organizational
  eRA Commons account for the small business.
- Does a small business need to identify an Institute or Center (IC) of interest prior
  to submission of an application to a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or
  Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) program?
- No. The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) Division of Receipt and Referral will
  assign each application to an appropriate, or primary, IC. When the scientific areas
  and the research proposed in a grant application are sufficiently relevant to two
  or more awarding institutes, CSR may make secondary assignments to relevant ICs.
  If the application is scientifically meritorious but the primary IC does not select
  it for award, then the other assigned ICs may consider the application for funding.
  The applicant is encouraged to contact the relevant Small Business Program Manager
  to discuss the appropriateness of the research area. Small Businesses may use the
  optional PHS Assignment Request Form in the SF424 Forms Version Gto request a specific
  institute or study section assignment. See NOT-OD-16-008. .
- My organization has received an NIH SBIR contract (or SBIR/STTR award from another
  agency) and would like to continue the research in an NIH Phase II, Phase IIB, or
  CRP grant. What should I enter for the Federal Identifier on the SF 424 (R&R) application
  page?
- "Submit a new application (instead of a renewal) with a predetermined \u201Calternative\u201D\
  \ grant number as the Federal Identifier. The Federal Identifier will be the awarding\
  \ NIH Institute or Center (IC) code followed by six zeroes. For example, if you\
  \ want the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to be the awarding\
  \ IC, enter HL000000. Please see the SF424 small business application forms for\
  \ more information. Note:Please inform the appropriateHHS Small Business Program\
  \ Managerbefore applying. Include a cover letter that indicates whether you\u2019\
  re applying for a Phase II, Phase IIB, or CRP and the NIH contract or federal agency\
  \ that funded your Phase I award. Questions? Contact theeRA Help Desk. ."
- Where can small businesses find information on the Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) program resubmission
  policy?
- Resubmissions are applications that were previously submitted and reviewed but not
  selected for an award and are being submitted again for evaluation. These applications
  include a one-page introduction addressing the comments of the previous reviewers.
  Resubmissions must be submitted within 37 months of the original application. For
  more details on the Resubmission Policy, visit the Resubmissions webpage and the
  Guide Notice. Following an unsuccessful application resubmission, applicants may
  submit a revised idea as a new application. .
- My Phase II resubmitted application was not successful. What are my options?
- You have multiple options if your Phase II resubmission will not be funded. You
  may apply for a new Phase I, which can focus on the same area but should be re-envisioned
  based on new developments in the field or ways you have rethought your approach.
  You also may apply for either a new Fast-Track (STTR or SBIR) or a Direct-to-Phase
  II (SBIR only). In both of these cases, as with a new Phase I, you can highlight
  results from your earlier project, in addition to any new data or other information
  you choose to bring to bear. For all of these options, including the Direct-to-Phase
  II, you must avoid making specific mention of the original Phase I award given the
  Direct-to-Phase II is a new application.
- If I incur problems with my electronic application submission, whom should I contact?
- Contact the Helpdesk for grants.gov and/or the eRA Commons for problems with electronic
  submission:. Grants.gov:. eRA Commons:.
- Who is eligible to apply for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small
  Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grants?
- "To be eligible to apply for SBIR or STTR grants, the organization must be a for-profit\
  \ small business and must satisfy the SBIR and STTR eligibility requirements. Further\
  \ information about SBIR/STTR eligibility requirements can be found within the NIH\
  \ Grants Policy Statement Section 18.5.2 \u201CEligibility.\u201D. ."
- Does there need to be a formal company to apply for a Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grant?
- Yes. The Grants.gov submission and registration processes require that an applicant
  be a formal entity in order to submit an application to the federal government.
  However, applicants need not meet the SBIR and STTR eligibility requirements until
  the time of award.
- Are Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) or Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB)
  given any advantage in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) program application process?
- "No. SBIR and STTR awards are reviewed on their scientific merit and funding decisions\
  \ are based on scientific merit, available budget, and program priority. The government\
  \ is Congressionally mandated to collect this information to report the demographic\
  \ information about NIH funding awards. The NIH, the Centers for Disease Control\
  \ and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration use the Business Type information\
  \ provided in the System for Award Management entity record for the applicant organization,\
  \ rather than the \u201CWoman Owned\u201D and \u201CSocially and Economically Disadvantaged\u201D\
  \ checkboxes on the application, to determine the small business organization type.\
  \ For more information, see NOT-OD-19-088."
- Must the Principal Investigator (PI) be a United States (US) citizen?
- No. The PI, the individual who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction
  of the project, is not required to have US citizenship. However, the PI (or all
  multiple PIs on a multiple PI application) must legally reside in the United States
  and must be available to perform the research proposed for the duration of the project.
- Does the NIH Early Stage Investigator (ESI) Policy apply to Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) applications?
- No. The advantages of ESI status applies only to applicants for traditional NIH
  research grants (R01s) or R01 equivalents. More information about ESI policies can
  be found on the NIH New and Early Stage Investigator (ESI) Policies page.
- May multiple Principal Investigators (PIs) be included on Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) program applications?
- "Yes. More than one PI, or multiple PIs, may be designated on the application for\
  \ projects that require a \u201Cteam science\u201D approach that clearly does not\
  \ fit the single-PI model. Each PI must have a PI role and a leadership plan is\
  \ required. The lead PI should be listed first and identified as the primary contact.\
  \ For further information about the Multiple PI model, please see the NIH Grants\
  \ Policy Statement Section 2.1.2 \u201CRecipient Staff.\u201D. All PIs must be registered\
  \ in the NIH eRA Commons system prior to the submission of the application. The\
  \ decision of whether to apply for a single PI or multiple PI grant is the responsibility\
  \ of the investigators and applicant organizations and should be determined by the\
  \ scientific goals of the project. Please read more about multiple PIs  and also\
  \ refer to the SF424 SBIR/STTR (R&R) Application Guide for more information about\
  \ the requirements for multiple PIs."
- For a multiple Principal Investigator (PI) application under the Small Business
  Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR)
  programs, which organization or institution should be designated as the lead?
- The small business is always the applicant and recipient organization, regardless
  of whether the project is submitted as an SBIR, STTR, single-PI, or multiple-PI
  application. The small business submitting the application is always the lead organization
  and any other organizations (including partner research institutions) subcontract
  to the small business.
- Do all of the Principal Investigators (PIs) on multiple-PI Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) applications
  have to meet the SBIR or STTR primary employment requirement?
- 'SBIR: The PI who serves as the primary contact must be from the small business
  and meet the primary employment requirement, but other PIs need not meet this requirement.
  Primary employment means that more than one half of the PI''s time is spent in the
  employ of the small business at the time of award and for the project duration.
  STTR: As is the case for a single-PI STTR project, the PIs are not all required
  to be employed by the small business. However, the first PI listed must have a formal
  appointment with, or commitment to, the small business. This appointment must be
  in the form of an official relationship between the parties but need not include
  a salary or other form of remuneration. If the primary contact PI is not an employee
  of the small business, the applicant organization must officially affiliate the
  PI with the small business in the eRA Commons system.'
- Under the multiple Principal Investigator (PI) model, is there a minimum person-months
  requirement to qualify as a PI on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small
  Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) applications?
- 'SBIR: No. There is no minimum person-months requirement for individuals identified
  as PIs. The reviewers will assess whether the level of effort is adequate to achieve
  the proposed goals. If there are deficiencies in this regard, it will negatively
  impact the review score. STTR: Yes. Each PI must commit a minimum of 1.2 calendar
  months (10 percent effort) to the project and each PI must have a formal appointment
  with or commitment to the applicant small business, which is characterized by an
  official relationship between the small business and that individual. Use the person-months
  website and calculator as a reference.'
- Who counts as an employee of a small business?
- An employee is any individual employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis,
  so long as that individual works a minimum of 40 hours per month. This includes
  employees obtained from a temporary employment agency, leasing concern, through
  a union agreement, or co-employed pursuant to a professional employer organization
  agreement. An owner is considered an employee if the owner works a minimum of 40
  hours per month regardless of whether the individual receives compensation. A volunteer
  (i.e., individuals who receive deferred compensation or no compensation, including
  no in-kind compensation, for work performed) is not considered an employee. Generally,
  an independent contractor (i.e., a 1099 employee) is not considered an employee.
  However, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will treat an independent contractor
  as an employee where there is evidence of an employee/employer relationship. SBA
  considers the totality of the circumstances in determining whether individuals are
  employees. Please refer to the SBA's Size Policy Compliance Guide, to determine
  whether individuals are employees.
- Are public companies eligible to apply for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grants?
- "Yes. Public companies are eligible, but they must self-certify they are more than\
  \ 50 percent directly owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens\
  \ or permanent resident aliens of the United States. When a firm goes public, it\
  \ must include its shareholders in its ownership determinations. Please review SBA\u2019\
  s Eligibility Guide for more detailed information."
- Can a small business that is owned by multiple venture capitalist (VC) companies
  apply for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology
  Transfer Research (STTR) programs?
- Yes. As long as the small business is more than 50 percent owned by multiple VC
  companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, or any combination of these, and meets
  all of the other eligibility criteria. No single VC company, hedge fund, or private
  equity firm may own more than 50 percent of the concern. For more information, please
  see NOT-OD-13-116. If the small business is majority-owned by multiple VC companies,
  they will need to complete the SBIR Venture Capital Operating Company (VCOC) forms
  available here. Step-by-step instructions can be found here.
- Is a joint venture eligible to apply for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) funding?
- "Yes. Since a joint venture is considered a separate business entity, it would qualify\
  \ under the SBIR program. However, all affiliated companies must be included in\
  \ the employee count for size determination and the corporate structure must follow\
  \ the ownership rules. Please consult \u201CSection III: Eligibility Information\u201D\
  \ of the relevant Omnibus Solicitation. The SBIR/STTR Application Guide SF424 also\
  \ contains relevant information concerning eligibility here."
- What kinds of entities are eligible as partner research institutions under a Small
  Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) application? How may their status be
  verified?
- The research institution must be owned and operated exclusively for scientific or
  educational purposes, not for profit, and located in the United States. Research
  institutions eligible to participate in the STTR Program include:.
- Can a small business use subawards (such as consortiums, Contract Research Organizations
  (CROs), or Fee for Service organizations) in an SBIR or STTR grant?
- Yes. Subawards are allowed in both SBIR and STTR grants. The contractual agreements
  must be negotiated by the small business with the subawards directly. These agreements
  must be based on project need and exercised when the small business cannot perform
  the work on its own. The SBIR and STTR programs delineate specific allowable work
  distributions for the small business and any subawards. These distributions depend
  on the grant program (SBIR vs. STTR) and the project phase (Phase I, Phase II, or
  Phase IIB). Details can be found here. Applicants should discuss any possible deviations
  from these guidelines with NIH program staff.
- What is the difference between a subaward, a consultant, and a Contract Research
  Organization (CRO) or Fee for Service?
- A subaward is an award provided by the small business to a subrecipient for that
  subrecipient to carry out part of the SBIR or STTR received by the small business.
  Characteristics of a subrecipient. The subrecipient:. A consultant may provide advisory
  services related to an award. A CRO or Fee for Service provider provides goods or
  services within normal business operations and operates in a competitive environment
  providing similar goods and services to a variety of customers. CROs or Fee for
  Service providers not operating in the capacity as a subaward or subrecipient may
  not be calculated in the total amount of all consultant and contractual arrangements
  to third parties for portions of the scientific and technical effort. Characteristics
  of a contractor or fee for service purchase order. The contractor organization:.
- Are subcontractors on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) applications required to provide a letter of
  support?
- Yes. For both SBIR and STTR programs, individuals and/or collaborating organizations
  must include a letter confirming their role on the proposed project. For the STTR
  program, a letter from the partner research institution must be included.
- Can a small business submit and be awarded a budget that exceeds the Small Business
  Administration (SBA) guidelines?
- The SBA allows NIH to consider funding awards over statutory budget limitations
  in SBA-approved NIH waiver topic areas. These topics apply to both the SBIR and
  STTR programs. Read the current waiver topics approved for different NIH ICs. Applicants
  are strongly encouraged to contact their Program Official (PO) prior to submitting
  any application. In all cases, applicants should propose a budget that is reasonable
  and appropriate for completion of their research project.
- What is a small business permitted to charge if it does not have a negotiated Facilities
  and Administrative (F&A, also known as indirect costs) rate with NIH?
- "The payment of indirect costs is based upon rates established through a formal\
  \ agreement between the recipient organization and the federal agency. Phase I applicants\
  \ who do not have a negotiated rate with a federal agency should propose an estimated\
  \ rate not to exceed 40 percent of the total direct costs. NIH will not negotiate\
  \ indirect rates for Phase I awards. Phase II and Phase IIB applicants who propose\
  \ a rate of 40 percent of total direct costs or less will not be required to provide\
  \ further justification if selected for an award. The indirect costs will be awarded\
  \ at the requested rate. The NIH Division of Financial Advisory Services will only\
  \ negotiate rates with applicants who request more than 40 percent of total direct\
  \ costs on a Phase II award. See the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 18.5.4.3.1\
  \ \u201DFacilities and Administrative Costs (Indirect Costs)\u201D."
- What is the "Fee"? How should a small business justify the fee in its application
  to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer
  Research (STTR) program?
- "A reasonable fee, not to exceed 7 percent of total costs (direct and indirect)\
  \ for each phase (Phase I, Phase II, or Phase IIB) of the project, is available\
  \ to small businesses receiving awards under the SBIR and STTR programs. The fee\
  \ is intended to be a reasonable profit factor available to for-profit organizations,\
  \ consistent with normal profit margins provided to profit-making firms for research\
  \ and development work. The fee may be used by the small business for any purpose,\
  \ including additional effort under the SBIR or STTR award. The fee is intended\
  \ for the small business awardee; however, the SBIR or STTR recipient may decide\
  \ to pay a portion of the fee to a contractor upon their discretion. See the NIH\
  \ GPS Section 18.5.4.2 \u201CProfit or Fee\u201D for more information."
- Are the allowable fee percentages different for Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I and Phase
  II applications?
- "No. The NIH\u2019s allowable limit for both Phase I and Phase II is 7 percent of\
  \ the combined total direct plus the indirect costs for each phase (Phase I, Phase\
  \ II, or Phase IIB) of the project. Institutes and Centers may accept the requested\
  \ amount or negotiate fee costs on a case-by-case basis, provided they do not exceed\
  \ the 7 percent limit."
- If applicants forget to request a fee on a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  or a Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) application, can they still
  receive a fee?
- No. See the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 18.5.4.2.
- May foreign work be proposed within a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) application? Can a small business
  subcontract with a foreign entity?
- "All work on SBIR or STTR projects must be conducted in the United States, per statute.\
  \ In rare or unique circumstances, NIH may allow a small portion of the research\
  \ work to be performed outside of the United States when it is not possible to perform\
  \ domestically. Some examples might include supplies, materials, or patient populations\
  \ that are not available in the United States. The approval of foreign involvement\
  \ will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be thoroughly justified in\
  \ the application. Whenever possible, non-SBIR or non-STTR funds should be used\
  \ for work outside of the United States that is necessary to the overall completion\
  \ of the project. Applicants should discuss their need for foreign involvement with\
  \ NIH program staff prior to submitting their application. Further information related\
  \ to this topic can be found in the NIH Grants Policy Statement Chapter 18.5.2.1\
  \ \u201CPlace of Performance.\u201D."
- Can small businesses collaborate with foreign scientists on a Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or a Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grant?
- "Foreign involvement will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be thoroughly\
  \ justified in the application. Whenever possible, non-SBIR or non-STTR funds should\
  \ be used for work outside of the United States that is necessary to the overall\
  \ completion of the project. Further information related to this topic can be found\
  \ in the NIH Grants Policy Statement Chapter 18.5.2.1 \u201CPlace of Performance.\u201D\
  . For SBIR and STTR grants:."
- Is foreign travel an allowable cost on a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  or a Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grant?
- Yes. Travel to a scientific meeting in a foreign country is allowable if such travel
  will provide direct benefit to the project. The request should be thoroughly justified
  regardless of the dollar amount requested, and the meeting should be related to
  the science proposed in the application. Allowable travel costs for small businesses
  may not exceed those established by the Federal Travel Regulation (available here).
- How can small businesses determine if their planned research is considered a clinical
  trial, per the NIH definition?
- Small business applicants follow the same Clinical Trials guidance as other grant
  applicants. To determine whether the study qualifies as a Clinical Trial, use the
  NIH Clinical Trials Decision Tool.
- Under which funding opportunity should a small business apply if the research project
  includes a clinical trial?
- "The NIH Office of Extramural Research \u2013 Clinical Trial Requirements page explains\
  \ the requirement(s) for submitting applications through a Funding Opportunity Announcement\
  \ (FOA) designated specifically for clinical trials. NIH offers both omnibus (parent)\
  \ solicitations and targeted, specific solicitations FOAs that allow for clinical\
  \ trials. Explore the omnibus (parent) and targeted solicitations."
- Is Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training required for small business grants?
- Yes. See this link for guidance and training options.
- If the human subjects work will be performed by a subcontractor, do I need Institutional
  Review Board (IRB) approval and Federalwide Assurance (FWA) also?
- No. Applicants do not need IRB approval or a FWA at the time of submission. The
  small business will need to obtain an Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP)
  approved FWA before the award is made for human subjects research that is not exempt.
  See the OHRP website for information on obtaining an FWA. If recipients do not have
  IRB approval by the time an award is made, a restricted award may be issued.
- Does the small business need an Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare Federalwide
  Assurance (FWA) for research involving vertebrate animals or human subjects if a
  collaborating institution has the approved assurance(s) and is conducting these
  studies on the project?
- Yes. As the recipient of federal funds, the small business of record is responsible
  for the conduct of all project activities that involve vertebrate animal or human
  subject participation.
- If a small business subcontracts all of the human or animal subjects work to a university,
  does it still need to address the human or animal subjects work in the research
  plan?
- "Yes. The research plan must include details of planned human or animal subjects\
  \ research, no matter who will be performing the research. Be sure to review the\
  \ \u201CSupplemental Instructions for Preparing the Human Subjects Section of the\
  \ Research Plan\u201D in the SF424 SBIR/STTR (R&R) Application Guide."
- When does a small business need Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
  approval?
- "NIH does not require IACUC approval of the proposed research before NIH peer review\
  \ of an application. However, the applicant must address the points under the \u201C\
  Vertebrate Animal\u201D section of the \u201COther Research Plan\u201D section.\
  \ IACUC approval must be obtained prior to award."
- Who is included in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Center for Scientific Review (CSR) peer review
  study sections?
- "There are specific small business study sections in the CSR for SBIR and STTR applications.\
  \ With few exceptions, SBIR and STTR applications are not reviewed in NIH\u2019\
  s standard academic study sections. The make-up of the small business study sections\
  \ includes both academic and industry professionals who have a robust knowledge\
  \ of product development and the NIH small business programs. CSR aims to have around\
  \ 25-50 percent representation of industry professionals on the review panel. The\
  \ academic professionals on the panel are also very familiar with the small business\
  \ program and frequently collaborate with small businesses on SBIR and STTR awards."
- How can someone become an NIH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small
  Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Center for Scientific Review (CSR)
  application reviewer?
- "The NIH CSR organizes peer review groups that evaluate the majority of NIH\u2019\
  s SBIR and STTR applications. The CSR welcomes researchers and entrepreneurs who\
  \ volunteer to serve on peer review groups. The best way to become a small business\
  \ panel reviewer is to send a r\xE9sum\xE9 or Curriculum Vitae to the CSR Scientific\
  \ Review Officer that organizes the small business study section that best fits\
  \ the individual\u2019s expertise or email SEEDinfo@nih.gov. A CSR Scientific Review\
  \ Officer will contact the individual if there is an opportunity available. Please\
  \ review CSR\u2019s \u201CBecome a Reviewer\u201D for more information."
- What do small businesses need to submit to NIH at the end of the grant budget period?
  When are these reports due?
- The NIH requires that small business recipients submit required reports within 120
  days of the end of the grant project period. If a no-cost extension has been requested
  and approved, the reports are due 120 days from the end date of the no-cost extension.
  The following reports are required:. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency
  Act of 2006 includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information
  about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards
  issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative
  agreements are required to report subawards over $25,000 to the Federal Subaward
  Reporting System (FSRS) available. See the Section 8.4.1.5.5 in the NIH Grants Policy
  Statement for additional information on this reporting requirement. Failure to submit
  timely final reports may affect future funding to the small business or awards with
  the same Principal Investigator. Click here for more information on reporting requirements.
- Are Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer
  Research (STTR) grants eligible to receive supplements after the initial award?
- "Yes. Supplements to active SBIR and STTR grants are allowable. There are two types\
  \ of supplements:. 1) Administrative supplement \u2013 an increase in support that\
  \ provides additional funding to a currently funded grant to meet increased costs\
  \ that are within the scope of the approved project, but that were unforeseen when\
  \ the award was made. Administrative supplements are evaluated by the Program Official\
  \ and do not require peer review. An example of an appropriate administrative supplement\
  \ might be a request for additional equipment items directly related to the project.\
  \ Another example is diversity supplements, which provide additional funds to support\
  \ research and entrepreneurial experiences for eligible groups that have been shown\
  \ to be underrepresented in health-related research. 2) Competing revision \u2013\
  \ an increase in support in a current budget period for expansion of the project's\
  \ approved scope or research protocol. In this instance, the small business requests\
  \ additional funding to expand the scope of the existing grant, requiring additional\
  \ personnel, equipment, and/or other expenses which must undergo peer review. Recipients\
  \ must follow the specific funding opportunity instructions and/or use the PHS 398\
  \ application."
- Does a small business need to recertify its eligibility if it has merged or been
  acquired by another business during the award?
- "In the case of a merger or acquisition, within 30 days of the transaction becoming\
  \ final (or the approved funding agreement novation if one is required), the recipient\
  \ must recertify its small business eligibility to NIH, or inform NIH that it is\
  \ no longer eligible to receive small business funding. If the business is no longer\
  \ eligible, NIH cannot provide any additional funding. Furthermore, the NIH and\
  \ the recipient must immediately revise all applicable federal grant databases to\
  \ reflect the new eligibility status. Please refer to the Small Business Administration\u2019\
  s Guide to SBIR/STTR Program Eligibility for further details."
- Does a small business have the right to file a patent if an NIH Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grant funded
  the work?
- Small businesses normally retain the principal worldwide patent rights to any invention
  they develop with government support, consistent with 35 United States Code (USC)
  200-212 and its implementing regulations. To the extent authorized by 35 USC 205,
  the government will not make public any information disclosing a government-supported
  invention to allow the recipient a reasonable time for filing a patent application.
  Under 37 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 401, the government receives a nonexclusive,
  nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice the subject invention
  throughout the world for, or on behalf of the United States. The government reserves
  the right to require the patent-holder to license others in certain circumstances,
  and requires that anyone exclusively licensed to use or sell the invention in the
  United States must normally substantially manufacture in the United States any product
  embodying or product through use of the subject invention. For more information,
  read about the Bayh-Dole Act.
- Is the inclusion of proprietary information in an application considered disclosure
  and does it disqualify a small business from applying for patents?
- "Applications are reviewed in closed private (non-public) sessions by reviewers\
  \ who are under strict confidentiality agreements with the federal government. Therefore,\
  \ information contained in applications would normally not be considered as a public\
  \ disclosure and should not affect the applicant\u2019s ability to apply for patents.\
  \ However, filing patent applications prior to submission of a funding application\
  \ is something applicants should consider in conjunction with their legal counsel.\
  \ Also, it should be noted that submitted abstracts are published upon award of\
  \ the grant, so the abstract should be drafted carefully so as not to be considered\
  \ as an enabling disclosure. Please review NIH\u2019s Guide Notice (NOT-OD-14-073)\
  \ about maintaining confidentiality during review and the NIH Grants Policy Statement\
  \ Section 2.3.11 \u201CAvailability and Confidentiality of Information.\u201D."
- Is a small business required to report inventions conceived or reduced to practice
  using NIH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology
  Transfer Research (STTR) funding?
- "According to NIH Grants Policy and federal law, NIH recipient organizations must\
  \ promptly report, via Interagency Edison (iEdison), all inventions that are either\
  \ conceived or first actually reduced to practice using NIH funding. Paper reporting\
  \ is not allowed (see NOT-OD-15-080 and NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 8.4.1.6\
  \ \u201CInvention Reporting\u201D). Information from these reports is retained by\
  \ the NIH as confidential and submission does not constitute any public disclosure.\
  \ Failure to report as described at 37 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Section\
  \ 401.14 is a violation of 35 United States Code (USC) 202 and may result in loss\
  \ of the rights of the recipient organization. Inquiries or correspondence should\
  \ be directed to:Division of Extramural Inventions and Technology ResourcesOffice\
  \ of Policy for Extramural Research AdministrationOffice of Extramural Research,\
  \ NIH. Telephone: (301) 435-1986Edison@nih.gov."
- Does the Bayh-Dole Act require small businesses to file a patent application for
  inventions conceived or reduced to practice using NIH Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) funding?
- If the small business makes a subject invention under an NIH funding award, the
  funded organization is required to choose whether it will either elect or not elect
  title to the subject invention. If the organization chooses to elect title, then
  the Bayh-Dole Act does require the funded organization to file a patent application
  on the subject invention in a timely manner. However, if the organization chooses
  not to elect title, then the organization need not file a patent application under
  the Bayh-Dole Act.
- If a small business employs a subcontractor to do particular work under a Small
  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research
  (STTR) award and the subcontractor makes a subject invention under that subaward,
  may that small business require the subcontractor to assign rights to that subject
  invention to the small business as part of the subcontract?
- No. 37 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 401.14 (a)(g) states, "The subcontractor
  will retain all rights provided for the contractor in this clause, and the contractor
  will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights
  in the subcontractor's subject inventions." Therefore, if the subject invention
  is solely invented by subcontractor staff, the small business cannot require assignment
  of rights from the subcontractor. However, if the subject invention is jointly made
  by an employee of the small business and an employee of the subcontractor, both
  the small business and the subcontractor would already be co-owners of the subject
  invention. This assumes that appropriate employment agreements are in place that
  require assignment to the respective employer.
- Are patent costs allowable under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or
  Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) funding award?
- "Generally, patent costs are not allowable under an SBIR or STTR funding award.\
  \ For more detailed information about the allowability of certain costs and activities\
  \ under NIH funding awards, view the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 7.9 \u201C\
  Allowability of Costs/Activities.\u201D Moreover, NIH will typically not negotiate\
  \ patent costs into Facilities & Administrative rates per the NIH Division of Financial\
  \ Advisory Services. It should be noted that there is a reasonable fee available\
  \ to small businesses receiving awards under the SBIR and STTR programs which can\
  \ be used for any purpose, such as covering patent expenses. However, this fee must\
  \ be included in the budget request at the time of application. For further information,\
  \ please see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 18.3.4 \u201CProfit or Fee\u201D\
  \ for further information. Applicants can also request Technical and Business Assistance\
  \ Funding to support intellectual property (IP) protection, including development\
  \ of patent applications, performing freedom-to-operate and patentability searches,\
  \ and analysis of existing IP and competitor products, and filing fees. An applicant\
  \ cannot directly request patent filing costs as part of TABA Funding. The Commercialization\
  \ Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program can support development of an intellectual property\
  \ strategy, including analysis of the patent landscape in the United States and\
  \ abroad. CRP awards cannot be used to pay filing fees associated with filing patents\
  \ or FDA submissions."
- Are patent costs, licensing fees, and legal fees allowable direct costs on Small
  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research
  (STTR) grants?
- Unless required by the grant, patent costs are not allowable. Only general counseling
  services relating to patent matters (such as advice on patent laws, regulations,
  clauses, and employee agreements) are allowable under Facilities and Administrative
  rates (Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 31.205-30). The license fees associated
  with using a patent necessary for the performance of a grant, are normally allowable
  expenses. There are situations where these are not allowable such as when the government
  has a royalty-free license or free use of the patents.
- Does a small business need intellectual property agreements as part of Small Business
  Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR)
  grant applications?
- No. These agreements need not be submitted as part of grant applications. However,
  a primary goal of the SBIR and STTR programs is the commercialization of technologies.
  When accepting funds under an SBIR or STTR award, the small business is certifying
  that it is on the path to move the funded research toward commercialization. An
  important aspect of this is securing intellectual property agreements. Whenever
  possible, intellectual property agreements should be worked out early in the process,
  to ensure that what the small business proposes will be achievable. Under an STTR
  award, which requires collaboration between a small business and a nonprofit research
  institution, it is expected that intellectual property issues between the partners
  will be addressed early on to ensure that the flow of the research, development,
  and commercialization of the project continues unimpeded. Accordingly, small businesses
  and nonprofit research institutions should consider using the "Model STTR Intellectual
  Property Agreement" to address the allocation of rights in intellectual property
  and rights to carry out follow-on research, development, or commercialization for
  an STTR award. This model agreement may also be considered for addressing similar
  situations under SBIR awards which may involve subcontractors.
- Do SBIR/STTR projects have to share scientific data under the Data Management &
  Sharing (DMS) Policy?
- Under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology
  Transfer (STTR) Program Policy Directive, SBIR and STTR awardees may withhold applicable
  data for 20 years after the award date, as stipulated in the specific SBIR/STTR
  funding agreement and consistent with achieving program goals. Read the DMS Policy.
- Can small businesses sell products that were developed with Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) funding to
  the federal government without competing with other vendors?
- "Normally, the government requires a full competition for the issuance of any federal\
  \ funds. However, the sole source provision enables small businesses to directly\
  \ sell the product or solution they developed with Small Business Innovation Research\
  \ (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) funding to any governmental\
  \ agency. If the product or solution meets the government\u2019s needs and the agency\
  \ wants to purchase the technology, the small business does not have to compete\
  \ for the contract with other vendors in the open market. Instead, the government\
  \ agency works internally with their acquisition experts to negotiate a contract\
  \ agreement with the small business. In this way, the small business can be the\
  \ sole bidder for any business opportunity, which does not have to be formally issued\
  \ in FedBizOpps.gov. The legal provision cited below can be found within each NIH\
  \ SBIR or STTR solicitation, listed under the second paragraph of \"Section I. Funding\
  \ Opportunity Description\" in \"Part 2. Full Text of Announcement.\". \"The competition\
  \ for SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phase II awards satisfies the competition requirement\
  \ of the Armed Services Procurement Act, the Federal Property and Administrative\
  \ Services Act, and the Competition in Contracting Act. Therefore, an agency that\
  \ wishes to fund an SBIR/STTR Phase III project is not required to conduct another\
  \ competition in order to satisfy those statutory provisions. As a result, in conducting\
  \ actions relative to a Phase III SBIR/STTR award, it is sufficient to state for\
  \ purposes of a Justification and Approval pursuant to FAR 6.302-5 that the project\
  \ is a SBIR/STTR Phase III award that is derived from, extends, or logically concludes\
  \ efforts performed under prior SBIR/STTR funding agreements and is authorized under\
  \ 10 U.S.C. 2304(b)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(b)(2).\"."
- Are small businesses that have been awarded federal Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I or Phase II
  funds eligible to be a sole source provider to the government?
- Yes. Any small business that has received an SBIR or STTR Phase I or Phase II award
  from any federal agency is eligible to become a sole source provider to the government
  without having to go through an open contract competition. The small business is
  not limited to offer their services and products only to the government agency which
  funded their SBIR or STTR project. For example, if a small business won an NIH SBIR
  Phase I or II award, they can be a sole source provider to any other federal agency
  like the Departments of Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, etc.
- Can Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) costs exceed $6,500 per year for a
  Phase I and $50,000 for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II or IIB?
- No. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA) Policy Directive, requested
  TABA costs may not exceed:. Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program awards
  (SB1) are not eligible for TABA.
- Are Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) costs included in the total cost Small
  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research
  (STTR) budget cost caps?
- In line with theNIH Grants Policy Statement Section 18.5.4.1Program Levels (Total
  Costs), Institutes and Centers have the discretion to set individual budget guidelines
  for their SBIR or STTR programs above and below the Small Business Administration
  (SBA) mandated budget caps. Budget guidelines for individual Institutes or Centers
  may include restrictions on the total cost of the project (direct cost, indirect
  costs, fees and TABA costs). Specific funding opportunity announcements may include
  available funds under these TABA amounts dependent upon availability of funds at
  an Institute or Center level. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contactprogram
  staffprior to submitting any application in excess of the SBA budgetary guidelines.
- How should applicants request Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) costs within
  an application?
- "Applicants must label the requested cost \u201CTechnical Assistance\u201D on one\
  \ of the lines from 8-10 under Section F. Other Direct Costs. Applicants should\
  \ include the following information in the budget justification:."
- Can applicants request Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) funds after a grant
  is awarded?
- 'Applicants can request TABA funds after an application is awarded through a supplement
  request, see the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Administrative Supplement for
  Providing Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) Funding to SBIR/STTR Awardees
  (Admin Supp) for instructions and participating Institutes or Centers. Institutes
  or Centers have the discretion to accept or reject TABA supplement requests in line
  with Section 8.1.2 Prior Approval Requirements of the NIH Grants Policy Statement.
  Budget guidelines for individual ICs may include restrictions on the total cost
  of the project (direct cost, indirect costs, fees and TABA costs), including supplement
  requests.'
- "Can a company request Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) costs for a service\
  \ provided by the small business applicant (or a division within the applicant\u2019\
  s firm) or subcontractor on the application or award?"
- No. Proposed TABA costs are only allowable if the proposed cost cannot be provided
  internally. Services provided by the small business applicant, affiliate of the
  small business applicant, an investor of the small business applicant, or a subcontractor
  or consultant of the requesting firm otherwise required as part the paid portion
  of the research effort cannot be included as TABA costs.
- Can a company request patent filing costs as part of Technical and Business Assistance
  (TABA) funds?
- An applicant cannot directly request patent filing costs as part of TABA. However,
  applicants can request funds to support intellectual property (IP) protection, including
  development of patent applications, performing freedom-to-operate and patentability
  searches, and analysis of existing IP and competitor products, and filing fees.
  Applicants can utilize the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business
  Technology Transfer Research (STTR) fee to pay for patent filing costs.
- What costs are considered research and development (R&D) versus Technical and Business
  Assistance (TABA)?
- "Costs for services that are considered research and development as identified in\
  \ the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer\
  \ Research (STTR) application or award are not allowable under TABA. TABA costs\
  \ cannot be allocable to the aims of a specific award and costs must qualify as\
  \ indirect costs in line withNIH Grants Policy Statement Section 7.4 \u2013 Reimbursement\
  \ of Facilities and Administrative Costs."
- What monitoring is required for Technical and Business Assistance (TABA)?
- Recipients are required to report on TABA in their progress reports, including benefits
  and results of the technical or business assistance.
- Can awardees rebudget Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) funds? Can overall
  TABA funds for a project be increased or decreased by rebudgeting?
- Recipients can rebudget TABA funds within TABA budget category by 25% without prior
  approval. Significant rebudgeting, defined as rebudgeting by 25% or more within
  the TABA budget category, require prior approval. Rebudgeting to include TABA costs
  when not originally requested and without NIH prior approval is not allowed. Rebudgeting
  to increase or decrease TABA funding is not allowed.
- Can awardees who request Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) utilize centralized
  NIH TABA services?
- 'No. Awardees who request and receive TABA through the grant award cannot utilize
  centralized NIH TABA services, such as the TABA Needs Assessment Program, for the
  phase of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology
  Transfer Research (STTR) that TABA services are requested. For Fast Track applications,
  centralized NIH TABA services may be used for any phase of the project that did
  not request TABA funds. However, both awardees who utilize centralized TABA services
  and awardees who receive TABA through the grant award can utilize non-TABA SEED
  innovator support, includingI-Corps, Concept to Clinic: Commercializing Innovation
  (C3i), regulatory assistance, or pitch coaching fromEntrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs).'
- What is the mission of the I-Corps at NIH program?
- The I-Corps at NIH mission is to empower entrepreneurs to develop and validate a
  strategic business model through diverse customer discovery to meet unmet clinical
  needs. I-Corps enables and accelerates the transformation of invention to impact.
- What should I expect as an I-Corps at NIH participant?
- "The I-Corps at NIH provides value for entrepreneurs, innovators, and scientists\
  \ on multiple dimensions. The top 5 values embraced by I-Corps are as follows:.\
  \ (Personal) Growth \u2013 I-Corps at NIH is about learning and appreciating the\
  \ potential for both technologies supported with Federal funds, and, more importantly,\
  \ for individuals as they grow and evolve as entrepreneurs. Integrity \u2013 There\
  \ is an expectation for accountability for teams to come to I-Corps with an open\
  \ mind to learn and explore. Each team member is pressed to express their commitment\
  \ to the time and effort involved in I-Corps prior to joining the cohort. Honesty\
  \ \u2013 Teams do not know what they do not know before they come into I-Corps.\
  \ It may be difficult, however, it is essential that teams listen with open ears\
  \ during customer discovery in order to distill truths. There is a tension to escape\
  \ the echo chamber while in I-Corps. Creativity \u2013 Innovation is at the heart\
  \ of the I-Corps program. Participants are encouraged to use their imagination to\
  \ secure customer discovery interviews and keep an open mind to where their technology\
  \ might make the most impact to meet clinical needs. Involvement \u2013 The program\
  \ runs as a cohort; teams learn from their interviews, instructors, and peers. I-Corps\
  \ is highly experiential, and participation is required in order to meet the goals\
  \ of conducting 100 interviews over 8 weeks."
- What are the eligibility requirements?
- For more detailed requirements, please refer to the eligibility section in the FOAPAR-22-073.
- Who from our company should participate in I-Corps?
- Teams must have three members:.
- Who would be a good industry expert?
- A good industry expert is someone with the right industry contacts in your area
  of commercialization. She or he should be an entrepreneur familiar with your small
  business and experienced in bringing technologies to the marketplace. This could
  be someone who has an established relationship with the company, like a board member
  or someone selected as a third-party resource. Ideally, the industry expert should
  have prior experience in developing and commercializing other products in the same
  space as your technology.
- How do we find our industry expert?
- Teams can source the industry expert internally (business development manager, board
  member, etc.) or externally, like a consultant or mentor with the National Innovation
  Network. Also take advantage of your regional network through theSmall Business
  Development Center orSCORE chapter.
- Is there flexibility in how the three required roles are filled on the I-Corps team?
- "Yes. For example, if the Principal Investigator (PI) or Program Director (PD)listed\
  \ ineRAis also the CEO, then the PD/PI can be assigned the I-Corps role of \u201C\
  C-Level\u201D and you can select a different senior level scientist to serve in\
  \ the PD/PI role. Here\u2019s an example: Sue Scientist is listed as the PD/PI in\
  \ eRA on the predicate Phase I award. Sue is also the CEO of SBC, Inc. and will\
  \ carry the role of C-Level on the I-Corps team. Sue recruits Robin Researcher,\
  \ also of SBC, Inc., to be listed in eRA as a Co-Investigator and carry the role\
  \ of PI or Technical Lead on the I-Corps team. Finally, Evan Expert, an external\
  \ advisor from Serial Entrepreneur, Inc. is listed in eRA as a Consultant to carry\
  \ the role of Industry Expert on the I-Corps team. Sue Scientist. SBC, Inc. PD/PI.\
  \ C-Level Executive. Robin Researcher. SBC, Inc. Co-Investigator. Technical Lead/Expert.\
  \ Evan Expert. Serial Entrepreneur, Inc. Consultant. Industry Expert. All teams\
  \ should include three members and should be led by someone with decision-making\
  \ authority within the company. We will not accept teams unless they meet the three-member\
  \ team requirement (no more, no less)."
- Is I-Corps only for new companies or teams with little commercialization experience?
- Not necessarily. Teams with limited commercialization experience may benefit the
  most, but all teams will take away valuable lessons and specific insights about
  their particular technology or innovation.
- What is the application timeline?
- Applications for Cohort 2 of the 2023 I-Corps at NIH must be received by February
  1, 2023, 5:00 p.m. your local time.

  \ closing workshop/final lessons learned."
- When are the next I-Corps at NIH cohorts?
- The schedule for upcoming I-Corps at NIH cohorts can be found in the Program Description
  section of the Funding Opportunity Announcement (PAR-22-073).
- What are the mandatory program activities?
- The I-Corps at NIH curriculum provides real-world, hands-on, immersive learning
  about what it takes to evaluate commercial opportunity around an innovation. The
  curriculum consists of an 8-week program that includes a 3-day immersion kickoff
  workshop and a 2-day closing workshop. During these workshops, team members will
  give presentations and participate in lectures and training sessions. Team members
  must participate in weekly webinar sessions and conduct at least 100 discovery interviews
  with potential customers, strategic partners, and other third-party stakeholders.
  At the end of the program, teams will present their final lessons learned.
- What are the time commitment requirements for the program? What about my other responsibilities?
- The I-Corps at NIH curriculum is rigorous and requires a substantial time commitment.
  Team members are expected to spend a minimum of 20 hours per week participating
  in and preparing for the scheduled I-Corps at NIH events and doing active customer
  discovery. Teams are advised to apply for the cohort that allows them to accommodate
  their scheduling demands accordingly.
- Will I get to choose which I-Corps at NIH cohort my team will join?
- Applications to I-Corps at NIH are tied to specific cohort dates, typically March/April
  or May/June. If the March/April cohort is oversubscribed, teams may be offered the
  option to participate in the May/June cohort, depending on availability.
- What is the best way to align my team with the program's expectations?
- 'Read the FAQs: https://seed.nih.gov/faqs#11894.'
- How should I prepare for my cohort?
- After registering for the I-Corps at NIH cohort (typically around 4 weeks prior
  to the start of the cohort), you will receive information on the cohort's logistics,
  syllabus, and required reading and videos. Please:.
- Will my intellectual property rights be protected when I discuss my ideas with the
  class?
- I-Corps workshops do not require that you share the specifics of your intellectual
  property. However, you will be sharing with the class what you learned on a weekly
  basis about reimbursement, regulation, customers, partners, etc. Your presentations,
  customer discovery, and validation notes, and business model canvas will be shared
  with the teaching team. You should consult an intellectual property attorney if
  you have specific legal questions.
- Does an applicant have to have a Phase II award to apply for a Phase IIB or Commercialization
  Readiness Pilot (CRP) award?
- Yes, an applicant needs to have been awarded a Phase II, which includes a Phase
  II as part of a Fast-Track, in order to apply for a Phase IIB or CRP award. A Phase
  IIB is intended to provide follow-on funding to Phase II awardees for those Phase
  II projects that require extraordinary time and effort in the research and development
  phase. A Phase IIB is awarded after the Phase II has ended, although the Phase IIB
  can be submitted while a Phase II is active. A CRP award is intended to facilitate
  the transition of previously or currently funded Small Business Innovation Research
  (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II and Phase
  IIB projects to the commercialization stage by providing additional support for
  technical assistance and, in some cases, later stage research and development not
  typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts. A CRP can
  be awarded while the Phase II or Phase IIB is active or after it has ended.
- Does an applicant need to meet small business eligibility requirements to receive
  a Phase IIB or Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) award? How can I find out
  the success rates for different institutes and programs?
- Yes, an applicant must be an eligible small business at the time of award to receive
  a Phase IIB or CRP award.
- How many Phase IIB and/or Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) awards can be
  connected to a Phase II project?
- A Phase II project may be awarded one Phase IIB (i.e. one renewal of the Phase II).
  Only one CRP is allowed per Phase II or Phase IIB project. A project that is awarded
  a CRP in the Phase II cannot be awarded an additional CRP during the Phase IIB.
- How many Phase IIB and/or Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) application submissions
  can be connected to a Phase II project? Can a Phase IIB and CRP application be submitted
  at the same time? How can I find out the success rates for different institutes
  and programs?
- "A Phase IIB is considered a renewal of the Phase II. Per NIH policy, only a single\
  \ resubmission of a renewal application will be accepted. Submission of a \u201C\
  new\u201D Phase IIB after an unsuccessful A1 is not allowed. Similarly, only a single\
  \ resubmission of a CRP application will be accepted. The CRP does utilize the \u201C\
  new\u201D application designation to allow active Phase II or Phase IIB grants or\
  \ contracts to receive a CRP concurrently with their active award. This does not\
  \ allow for a \u201Cnew\u201D CRP application after an unsuccessful resubmission\
  \ of a CRP application. NIH will not accept Phase IIB and CRP applications for the\
  \ same Phase II project concurrently, i.e. Phase IIB and CRP applications for the\
  \ same Phase II project cannot be under review at the same time, even if they are\
  \ scientifically distinct."
- Is matching funding required for a Phase IIB? What constitutes matching funding
  for a Phase IIB?
- Matching funding is encouraged, but not required for a Phase IIB. Commercial potential
  (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will
  be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information)
  and making funding decisions. Applicants are encouraged (but not required) to secure
  substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that
  equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). An applicant's ability to secure substantial
  independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential
  of the proposed Phase IIB project. Examples of third-party investors include, but
  are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor,
  a foundation, a university, a research institution, or a State or local government,
  or any combination of the above.
- What are the significant differences between the Phase IIB and Commercialization
  Readiness Pilot (CRP) program? How can I find out the success rates for different
  institutes and programs?
- There are several significant differences between the Phase IIB and CRP programs.
  . Phase IIB. CRP. Grant Mechanism. R44 (SBIR) or R42 (STTR). SB1. Timing in relation
  to Phase II. Awarded after Phase II project has ended, although the Phase II can
  be active when the Phase IIB is submitted. Awarded concurrent with or after the
  Phase II or Phase IIB award has ended. Out-Sourcing Guidelines. The total amount
  of all consultant and contractual agreements to third parties for portions of the
  scientific and technical effort generally may not exceed 50 percent of the total
  amount requested. Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss deviations from
  these guidelines with NIH program staff listed in the Funding Opportunity Announcement.
  A substantial portion of the CRP award may be subcontracted to third parties through
  consultant and contractual arrangements. The small business must perform a substantive
  role in the conduct of the planned research and not merely serve as a conduit of
  funds to another party or parties. This includes being able to provide appropriate
  oversight of all scientific, programmatic, financial, and administrative matters
  related to the grant. Funding Opportunities. Applications are accepted through the
  Omnibus (Institutes or Centers must accept Phase II competing renewals) or specific
  funding opportunities (https://seed.nih.gov/small-business-funding/find-funding/sbir-sttr-funding-opportunities).
  Specific funding opportunities (https://seed.nih.gov/support-for-small-businesses/commercialization-enhancement-programs/crp).
  Matching Funding. Matching funding is strongly encouraged to indicate commercial
  potential. Not specifically mentioned in the funding opportunities. . Not all NIH
  Institutes and Centers participate in the Phase IIB or CRP program. The Food and
  Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not participate
  in the Phase IIB or CRP program. Applicants are encouraged to speak with their program
  officer about the best options for their project. .
