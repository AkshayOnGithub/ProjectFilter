- What is Olympism?
- Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the
  qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism
  seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value
  of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical
  principles. The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious
  development of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned
  with the preservation of human dignity.
- What is the Olympic Charter?
- "The Olympic Charter (OC) is the codification of the Fundamental Principles of Olympism,\
  \ Rules and byelaws adopted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It governs\
  \ the organisation, action and operation of the Olympic Movement and sets forth\
  \ the conditions for the celebration of the Olympic Games. The Fundamental Principles\
  \ of the Olympic Charter are based on a document written by Pierre de Coubertin\
  \ in around 1898. The first edition was published in 1908 under the title of Annuaire\
  \ du Comit\xE9 International Olympique. The Olympic Charter was later known by other\
  \ names, including \u201COlympic Rules\u201D, before finally taking the name Olympic\
  \ Charter in 1978."
- What are the Olympic Values?
- The three values of Olympism are excellence, respect and friendship . They constitute
  the foundation on which the Olympic Movement builds its activities to promote sport,
  culture and education with a view to building a better world.
- What is the Olympic Movement?
- "The Olympic Movement is composed of three main constituents: the International\
  \ Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Sports Federations (IFs) and the National\
  \ Olympic Committees (NOCs). In addition to these three constituents the Olympic\
  \ Movement is made up of all the organisations which recognise the IOC\u2019s authority:\
  \ the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), the athletes, judges\
  \ and referees, associations and clubs, as well as all the IOC-recognised organisations\
  \ and institutions. As is clearly defined in the Olympic Charter, \u201C The goal\
  \ of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world\
  \ by educating youth through sport practised in accordance with Olympism and its\
  \ values .\u201D ( Olympic Charter, Chapter 1, Rule 1.1 )."
- What is a National Olympic Committee (NOC)?
- National Olympic Committees are one of the three constituents of the Olympic Movement,
  alongside the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Sports
  Federations. Their role is to ensure the representation of their respective countries
  at the Olympic Games by sending competitors and officials as well as to promote
  the fundamental principles and values of Olympism in their countries, in particular
  in the fields of sport and education. They may also nominate interested hosts as
  candidates for future Olympic Games. There are currently 206 NOCs.
- What is the role of the International Sports Federations (IFs)?
- The International Sports Federations (IFs) establish the rules that govern their
  sport and ensure that they are applied. They are responsible for the technical aspects
  of their sport at the Olympic Games. The IFs ensure that their sport is developed
  worldwide and disseminate the values of Olympism through their activities.
- What role does the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) play?
- The CAS is an independent institution serving sport throughout the world. Its job
  is to settle all sports-related legal disputes.
- What is the Olympic Truce?
- "The \u201COlympic Truce\u201D or \u201CEkecheiria\u201D is a tradition that was\
  \ established in Ancient Greece in the 9th century B.C. by the signature of a treaty\
  \ between three kings. Subsequently, all the other Greek cities ratified this \u201C\
  international agreement\u201D, thanks to which permanent, recognised immunity of\
  \ the sanctuary of Olympia and the region of Elis became a reality. During the Truce\
  \ period, the athletes, artists and their families, as well as ordinary pilgrims,\
  \ could travel in total safety to participate in or attend the Olympic Games and\
  \ return afterwards to their respective countries. In 1991, the IOC decided to revive\
  \ the concept of the Olympic Truce on the occasion of the Olympic Games, with a\
  \ view to protecting, as far as possible, the interests of the athletes and sport\
  \ in general, and to contribute to the search for peaceful and diplomatic solutions\
  \ to the world\u2019s conflicts. Since 1993, the United Nations General Assembly\
  \ has repeatedly expressed its support for the IOC by unanimously adopting, every\
  \ two years, a year before each edition of the Olympic Games, a resolution entitled\
  \ \"Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal\".\
  \ Through this (symbolic) resolution, the UN invites its member States to observe\
  \ the Olympic Truce individually or collectively, and to seek, in conformity with\
  \ the goals and principles of the United Nations Charter, the peaceful settling\
  \ of all international conflicts through peaceful and diplomatic means, recognising\
  \ the importance of the IOC\u2019s initiatives for human well-being and international\
  \ understanding."
- What is the Olympic Family?
- The Olympic Family regroups diverse groups of leaders from the Olympic Movement
  , including the IOC President and IOC Members, International Federations a nd National
  Olympic Committees Presidents and Secretaries General, Chairs and CEOs of TOP Partners,
  future OCOG senior executives, RHB senior executives and others.
- What are the Olympic properties?
- 'The Olympic properties are: - The Olympic symbol (rings) - The Olympic flag - The
  Olympic motto - The Olympic anthem - Olympic identifications (including but not
  limited to "Olympic Games" and "Games of the Olympiad") - Olympic designations -
  Olympic emblems - The Olympic flame and torches The International Olympic Committee
  (IOC) owns all rights on the Olympic properties.'
- What is the meaning of the Olympic rings?
- The Olympic symbol consists of five interlaced rings of equal dimensions, used alone,
  in one or in five different colours, which are, from left to right, blue, yellow,
  black, green and red. The Olympic symbol (the Olympic rings ) expresses the activity
  of the Olympic Movement and represents the union of the five continents and the
  meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games. But watch out,
  it is wrong to say that each of the colours corresponds to a certain continent!
  In fact, when Pierre de Coubertin created the Rings in 1913, the five colours combined
  with the white background represented the colours of the flags of all nations at
  that time, without exception.
- Who created the Olympic rings symbol?
- The Rings appeared for the first time in 1913 at the top of a letter written by
  Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games. He drew and coloured
  the rings by hand. In the Olympic Review of August 1913, he explained that " These
  five rings represent the five parts of the world now won over to Olympism and ready
  to accept its fertile rivalries. Moreover, the six colours thus combined reproduce
  those of all the nations without exception ."
- Can I use the Olympic rings?
- 'The Olympic rings are the exclusive property of the International Olympic Committee
  (IOC). They are a mark protected around the world and cannot be used without the
  IOC''s prior written consent. You can send a detailed request to legal@olympic.org
  which must include the below information: Who is making the request? Name, full
  address, telephone and/or fax number, e-mail address. Organisation, company, museum
  or individual. Which content is concerned? (texts, images or films) How will the
  content be used? Private use (no broadcasting), school work, group activities, exhibition,
  production/broadcasting'
- Is it possible to obtain an Olympic flag?
- The Olympic flag is an Olympic property. Its use is reserved for the Olympic Games.
  For this reason, it cannot be made available for public use.
- What is the Olympic creed ?
- "\" The important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight; the essential\
  \ thing is not to have won, but to have fought well .\" Inspired by the words of\
  \ the Bishop of Pennsylvania, Ethelbert Talbot, Pierre de Coubertin first spoke\
  \ this phrase in a slightly different form at a reception given by the British government\
  \ on 24 July 1908. It went on to become the Olympic Movement\u2019s creed."
- What is the Olympic motto?
- "The original Olympic motto is made up of three Latin words : Citius - Altius -\
  \ Fortius. These words mean Faster - Higher - Stronger. On the 20th of July 2021,\
  \ the Session of the International Olympic Committee approved a change in the Olympic\
  \ motto that recognises the unifying power of sport and the importance of solidarity.\
  \ The change adds the word \u201Ctogether\u201D after an en dash to \u201CFaster,\
  \ Higher, Stronger\u201D. The new Olympic motto now reads in Latin \u201CCitius,\
  \ Altius, Fortius - Communiter\u201D and \u201CFaster, Higher, Stronger - Together\u201D\
  \ in English. The original motto was first expressed by the Dominican priest Henri\
  \ Didon in the opening ceremony of a school sports event in 1881. Pierre de Coubertin,\
  \ who was present that day, adopted them as the Olympic motto in 1894 with the launch\
  \ of the Olympic Movement. It expresses the aspirations of the Olympic Movement\
  \ not only in its athletic and technical sense but also from a moral and educational\
  \ perspective. The Olympic motto is an Olympic property."
- Who wrote the Olympic anthem?
- 'The music for the Olympic anthem was composed by Spiros Samaras, to words by Kostas
  Palamas, for the first Games in Athens in 1896. Various musical arrangements went
  on to be played at the opening ceremonies. In 1958, in Tokyo, the IOC Session decided
  that the Samaras/Palamas composition would be the official Anthem as of the 1960
  Games (Squaw Valley and Rome). The Olympic anthem is one of the Olympic properties:
  Olympic Charter: Chapter 1, Rule 7.4 and its Bye-law and Rule 12'
- What is the Olympic flame and the Torch relay?
- The Olympic flame is the flame which is kindled in Olympia under the authority of
  the IOC. In the context of the modern Games, the Olympic flame is a manifestation
  of the positive values that Man has always associated with the symbolism of fire
  and thus makes the link between the ancient and the modern Games. A few months before
  the opening of the Olympic Games, a flame is lit at Olympia, in Greece. The location
  recalls the link between the Ancient Olympic Games and their modern counterpart.
  From there, the Flame is carried for a number of weeks to the host city, mainly
  on foot by runners, but also using other forms of transport. Throughout the Torch
  relay, the flame announces the Olympic Games and spreads a message of peace and
  friendship between peoples. The Torch relay ends at the opening ceremony of the
  Olympic Games. The final runner (or sometimes runners) enters the stadium and lights
  the cauldron with the Olympic flame. The Games can then begin!
- When was the first Olympic Torch relay held?
- 'For the Summer Games, the first Olympic torch relay was in 1936. Reviving the idea
  of the torch races in Ancient Greece, the Secretary General of the Organising Committee
  for the Games in Berlin, Carl Diem, proposed that a flame be lit at Olympia and
  then relayed on foot to Berlin. That year, more than 3,000 athletes from seven countries
  took part in the relay. For the Winter Games, the first Torch relay was at the 1952
  Games in Oslo. It did not begin in Olympia, Greece, but in the Morgedal valley in
  Norway. It is only since the 1964 Games in Innsbruck that the relay has started
  in Olympia. Learn more: Factsheet: The Olympic Torch Relay Educational Series: The
  Olympic Flame and the Torch Relay Reference documents on the Olympic torch relays
  ( Summer / Winter )'
- Who chooses the Olympic poster?
- The official Olympic poster promotes a specific edition of the Olympic Games and
  is usually selected by the Organising Committee. It was not until the 1912 Olympic
  Games in Stockholm (Sweden) that an official poster was planned for and executed.
  Since 1912, host cities have been in charge of organising the promotion and advertising
  of each edition of the Games
- Who is responsible for creating the emblem, the medals' design and the mascot of
  the Olympic Games?
- The responsibility of designing the emblem, the medals and the mascot of an Olympic
  Games or Youth Olympic Games edition lies within its Organising Committee, but approval
  by the IOC Executive Board is needed to ensure compliance with the Olympic Charter
  and the requirements set forth in the Olympic Host Contract.
- Who is the owner of the properties of one Games edition?
- "For as long as the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games exists, the properties\
  \ (medals, emblems, mascot\u2026) are the exclusive property of the OCOG. Upon the\
  \ expiry of this period, all rights in or relating to such emblem, mascot and other\
  \ marks, designs, badges, posters and objects shall thereafter belong entirely to\
  \ the IOC. Hence, any request related to the use of such properties should be directed\
  \ to the OCOG directly, if still existing (e.g. Beijing 2022, Paris 2024, Milano\
  \ Cortina 2026, Los Angeles 2028)."
- How can a new sport be included in the Olympic Games programme?
- Initial sports programme The sports programme, which includes all sports for a specific
  edition of the Olympic Games, is determined by the IOC Session from among the sports
  governed by the I nternational F ederation s (IFs) recognised by the IOC. Only sports
  which comply with the Olympic Charter, the World Anti-Doping Code and the Olympic
  Movement Code on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competition are eligible
  to be in the programme. OCOG proposed sports With the implementation of Olympic
  Agenda 2020 (adopted in December 2014) , the process of establishing the Olympic
  programme changed to enhance the popularity of the Games while ensuring that the
  numbers of athletes, and the cost and complexity of the event, remain manageable.
  As part of this new process the Organising Committee of a specific edition of the
  Olympic Games may propose to the IOC the inclusion, for such edition only, of one
  or more additional events from the sports governed by the IOC Recognised IFs. Tokyo
  2020 Organising Committee was the first OCOG able to propose new sports and included
  five new sports for its edition of the Summer Games - surfing, karate, sports climbing,
  skateboarding and baseball/softball.
- What are the conditions required for a sport to be recognised by the IOC?
- To be recognised by the IOC, a sport must first of all be governed by an International
  Federation (IF). This is required in order to conform to the Rules of the Olympic
  Charter, the World Anti-Doping Code as well as the Olympic Movement Code on the
  Prevention of Manipulation of Competitions.
- "The Olympic programme comprises sports, disciplines and events \u2013 what is the\
  \ difference between the three?"
- A sport is that which is governed by an International Federation (IF). A discipline
  is a branch of a sport comprising one or more events. An event is a competition
  in a sport or discipline resulting in a ranking and giving rise to the awarding
  of medals and diplomas. Thus, skiing is a sport, while cross-country skiing, Alpine
  skiing, snowboarding, ski jumping and Nordic combined are disciplines. Alpine skiing
  is a discipline, while the super-G, giant slalom, slalom and combined are events.
- Who is responsible for adding events or disciplines to the programme of the Olympic
  Games?
- The event programme for the Olympic Games is defined by the IOC Executive Board
  upon recommendations of the Olympic Programme Commission and in cooperation with
  the International Federations and the respective Organi s ing Committee of the Olympic
  Winter Games. More specifically, any proposal for a new event put forward by the
  respective International Federation goes through a very strict review and decision-making
  process led by the Olympic Programme Commission, which involves representatives
  of athletes, International Federations and National Olympic Committees.
- Who is responsible for the rules governing an Olympic sport?
- The International Sports Federations (IFs) are responsible for the governance and
  technical management of their sport at the Olympic Games. As such, all questions
  or comments should be addressed directly to the IFs.
- Which sports are on the programme of the next Games?
- "The list of sports on the programme of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 is available\
  \ on the official website of the Organising Committee: \"Olympic Sports\" section.\

- What do winners at the Olympic Games receive?
- "The first three athletes receive a medal. The first eight athletes in each event\
  \ receive a diploma, and their names are announced to the public. Since the 1932\
  \ Winter Games in Lake Placid (USA), the medal award ceremony has always been made\
  \ on a podium. The first-placed athlete, on the highest step in the centre, receives\
  \ a gold medal and the title of Olympic champion. The second-place athlete stands\
  \ to the winner\u2019s right, and receives a silver medal; while the third-placed\
  \ athlete stands to the left and receives a bronze medal. The flags of all three\
  \ athletes are raised, and the winner\u2019s national anthem is played."

- You can find all Olympic medallists and the results of the latest Games editions
  in the " Olympic Results " section of our website.
- What does an athlete have to do to participate in the Olympic Games?
- "Taking part in the Olympic Games is every athlete\u2019s dream, and requires huge\
  \ amounts of determination and long years of training. Athletes must first comply\
  \ with the Olympic Charter and follow the rules of the International Federation\
  \ (IF) governing their sport. The IFs establish the rules and organise qualifying\
  \ events, while the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the athlete\u2019s country\
  \ supports the athlete and is responsible for entering them for the Games."
- What is the age limit for taking part in the Olympic Games?
- There is no specific age limit for taking part in the Olympic Games. This depends
  on each International Sports Federation and the rules it lays down for its sport.
- "\uFEFF\uFEFF\uFEFFCan I compete for another team than my nationality?"
- According to the Olympic Charter (Rule 40-41) Any competitor in the Olympic Games
  must be a national of the country of the NOC which is entering such competitor.
  A competitor who is a national of two or more countries at the same time may represent
  either one of them, as he may elect. However, after having represented one country
  in the Olympic Games, in continental or regional games or in world or regional championships
  recognised by the relevant IF, he may not represent another country unless certain
  circumstances. All matters relating to the determination of the country which a
  competitor may represent in the Olympic Games shall be resolved by the IOC Executive
  Board.
- How many countries and athletes participate in the Olympic Games ?
- There are no countries participating in the Olympic Games, but rather athletes from
  National Olympic Committees (NOCs). At the Olympic Summer Games in Paris in 2024,
  around 10,500 athletes from 206 NOCs will compete. At the Olympic Winter Games,
  there are usually around 2,900 athletes from more than 80 NOCs taking part in the
  competitions.
- "\uFEFF\uFEFF\uFEFFWhere do the athletes live during the Olympic Games?"
- "During the two weeks of the Games, the athletes live in the Olympic Village. This\
  \ is a residential complex, generally located close to the Olympic stadium, where\
  \ the world\u2019s athletes in all the Olympic sports live together. The Olympic\
  \ Village is safe and comfortable. During the Games, it provides for all the athletes\u2019\
  \ needs and protects them from disturbance by the outside world. The Village includes\
  \ the athletes\u2019 accommodation, together with an international zone which includes\
  \ shops, various services and leisure facilities. Once the Games are over, the Olympic\
  \ Village is usually turned into a new residential zone for the host city, with\
  \ the accommodation being sold or rented to the local population. However, the athletes\
  \ have not always had their own Village. The accommodation provided for the 1932\
  \ Games in Los Angeles is regarded as the first official modern Olympic Village."
- I would like to be a volunteer at the Olympic Games. What do I have to do?
- 'The thousands of volunteers greatly contribute to the success of the Games. The
  recruitment of volunteers for the Olympic Games is under the responsibility of the

- What are the YOG?
- The Youth Olympic Games are the ultimate multi-sports event for young athletes,
  but they are more than just competing and performing. They are about learning important
  skills, connecting to other cultures and celebrating the Olympic values of excellence,
  friendship and respect. The Youth Olympic Games are essentially about competing,
  learning and sharing. The mission of the YOG is to shape and influence the athletes
  and other young participants, to prepare them to become ambassadors of Olympism,
  of sport and of a healthy lifestyle so they can take on an active role in their
  community.
- What is the difference between the Olympic Games (OG) and the Youth Olympic Games
  (YOG)?
- The YOG are for the world's young athletes aged from 15 to 18. Like the Olympic
  Games, they are held every four years, and are held in the same year as the OG with
  the Summer YOG taking place the same year as the Olympic Winter Games and vice-versa.
  The Summer YOG Nanjing 2014 gathered almost 3,800 young athletes, whereas the OG
  London 2012 welcomed more than 10,500 athletes. The Summer and Winter YOG last 12
  and 10 days respectively, while the OG may last up to 16 days. The sports programme
  is based on that of the Olympic Games, with 28 sports for the Summer YOG and seven
  for the Winter YOG. However, the events are different, adapting to the age range
  and interests of the younger athletes. The YOG also include Learn & Share activities
  (known previously as Culture and Education Programme (CEP)).
- What is the origin of the Youth Olympic Games (YOG)?
- The YOG were created at the initiative of the former President of the International
  Olympic Committee (IOC), Jacques Rogge. His idea was approved unanimously by the
  IOC members at their Session in July 2007 In Guatemala City. The 1st Summer YOG
  were held in Singapore, in August 2010. The 1st Winter YOG were held in Innsbruck,
  in January 2012. The objective of the YOG is to encourage young people around the
  world to practise sport; raise awareness of and encourage them to adopt the values
  of Olympism; and disseminate the message of the Olympic Movement around them.
- How are the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) financed?
- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) contributes to the financing of the YOG.
  It covers the costs of transport and accommodation for the athletes and team officials
  in the Olympic Village as well as for representatives from the International Sports
  Federations (IFs) and IOC representatives in hotels. It also finances the TV production.
  The Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (YOCOG) shall be responsible for the
  planning, organising and staging of the YOG. On the other hand, the host city is
  responsible for the improvements to be made to sports and non-sports facilities
  and venues, where applicable.
- What age are the athletes competing in the Youth Olympic Games (YOG)?
- The young athletes must be 15, 16, 17 or 18 years old on 31 December in the year
  of the Games. The age groups for the events in which they compete are defined in
  collaboration with the International Sports Federations (IFs) concerned. Dakar 2026
  age requirements (15-18) shall remain the same even though the event has been postponed.
- How can a young athlete qualify to take part in the Youth Olympic Games (YOG)?
- The qualification of youth athletes is prepared in collaboration with the International
  Federations (IFs). For each discipline, world and continental junior championships
  as well as world junior rankings and qualifying events allow the athletes to qualify
  for the YOG. If a young athlete is interested in taking part in the YOG, he/she
  must contact his/her National Olympic Committee (NOC), which will inform him/her
  of the qualification criteria. The NOC is responsible for managing its delegation
  during the YOG.
- How many athletes compete in the Youth Olympic Games (YOG)?
- There are around 4'000 athletes for the Summer YOG from all of the NOCs, and about
  1'780 athletes from 79 NOCs for the Winter YOG.
- Where and when will the next Youth Olympic Games (YOG) take place?
- In January 2020, the 135th IOC Session held in Lausanne voted to elect the Province
  of Gangwon as host of the 4th Winter Youth Olympic Games. The YOG will take place
  from 19 January to 1 February 2024. The fourth edition of the Summer Youth Olympic
  Games will take place in Dakar, Senegal in 2026. The IOC members took this decision
  unanimously by a show of hands at the IOC Session in Buenos Aires in October 2018.
  In a decision approved during the 136th Session of the IOC on 17 July 2020, Senegal
  and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) mutually agreed to postpone the Youth
  Olympic Games (YOG) in Dakar from 2022 to 2026 because of the COVID-19.
- What are the changes to the event programme of the Winter Youth Olympic Games Gangwon
  2024?
- 'In addition to the replacement of mixed NOC events with equivalent events of the
  same format composed of teams of athletes from the same NOCs, the IOC Executive
  Board established the following event changes: Short Track Speed Skating: Two new
  1,500m individual events (1M/1W) Cross-Country Skiing: One new mixed-gender relay
  to replace the Cross-Country Cross events Nordic Combined: One new mixed-gender
  team event Freestyle Skiing: Increase from 8 to 10 events per discipline, confirming
  the 4 events in Slopestyle and Big Air while leaving 6 individual and/or mixed-gender
  events to be confirmed among Ski Cross, Dual Moguls and Halfpipe Snowboard: Increase
  from 8 to 10 events per discipline, confirming the 4 events in Slopestyle and Big
  Air while leaving 6 individual and/or mixed-gender events to be confirmed among
  Snowboard Cross, Snowboard Parallel and Halfpipe.'
- "Who are the \u201CAthlete Role Models\u201D for the Youth Olympic Games?"
- For each edition of the Youth Olympic Games, sporting stars of different nationalities
  are selected by their International Federations to spend time with the young athletes,
  answer their questions and share their experiences in the Youth Olympic Village,
  at competition and training venues and during a series of educational workshops
  and activities.
- What is the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and what is its mission?

  \ the Olympic Movement 11. to resolve and decide upon all other matters assigned\
  \ to it by law or by the Olympic Charter."
- What is the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)?
- The Executive Board is the executive body of the IOC. It assumes the general overall
  responsibility for the administration of the IOC and monitors compliance with the
  Olympic Charter. The Board is made up of the IOC President, four vice-presidents
  and 10 other members, all elected by the Session.
- How is the IOC President elected and what is his role?
- "The IOC President is elected by secret ballot by the IOC members at the Session.\
  \ The President\u2019s term of office is eight years, and can be renewed once, for\
  \ four years. The ninth IOC President Thomas Bach was elected on 10 September 2013\
  \ at the 125 th IOC Session in Buenos Aires. The role of the President is to represent\
  \ the IOC and to preside over all its activities. He establishes election rules,\
  \ except for the election of the President. He can also take a decision on behalf\
  \ of the IOC, when circumstances dictate that the IOC Session or Executive Board\
  \ cannot do so."
- Who has been IOC President since 1894?
- "To date, the IOC has had nine Presidents. In chronological order: Demetrius Vikelas\
  \ (Greece), President from 1894 to 1896 Pierre de Coubertin (France), President\
  \ from 1896 to 1925 Henri de Baillet-Latour (Belgium), President from 1925 to 1942\

- Who can become IOC President?
- To become President, it is first necessary to be an IOC member . Among its members,
  the IOC has active and former athletes, as well as presidents or high-level leaders
  of National Olympic Committees (NOCs), International Sports Federations (IFs) and
  international organisations recognised by the IOC.
- Which are the Commissions of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)?
- 'There are different Commissions within the IOC, such as, for example: The Athletes''
  Commission The Women In Sport Commission The Sport And Active Society Commission
  The Marketing Commission The Ethics Commission The Commissions are formed at the
  request of the IOC President, with the aim of advising the Session, the IOC Executive
  Board or the President as the case may be.'
- How does one become an IOC member?
- "To become an IOC member, it is necessary to be elected by the IOC Session by a\
  \ majority of the votes cast. The IOC recruits and elects its members from among\
  \ the people it deems qualified. The IOC\u2019s members include active athletes,\
  \ former athletes and the presidents or senior leaders of the International Sports\
  \ Federations (IFs) or international organisations recognised by the IOC."
- How can I contact the IOC or an IOC Member ?
- 'You can either send your message via this form or send your correspondence to the
  following address. Upon evaluation, your message will be forwarded to the appropriate
  service/person: International Olympic Committee Maison Olympique 1007 Lausanne Switzerland'
- What is Olympic Solidarity?
- "Olympic Solidarity is one of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\u2019s commissions.\
  \ Its job is to organise the assistance the IOC gives to the National Olympic Committees\
  \ (NOCs) to help them develop sport in their respective countries. Through Olympic\
  \ Solidarity, athletes can benefit from the \u201COlympic scholarships for athletes\u201D\
  \ programme, which allocates subsidies enabling athletes to train and qualify for\
  \ the Olympic Games."
- I would like to work for the IOC. What should I do?
- "Job offers and IOC internships as well as useful information on professional development\
  \ at our organisation are available on the \u201C IOC Careers \u201D platform. Applications\
  \ for vacancies can be submitted via this online space."
- What are Olympic Agenda 2020 and Olympic Agenda 2020+5?
- "Olympic Agenda 2020 is a strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement\
  \ that was launched by IOC President Thomas Bach after his election in September\
  \ 2013. A year of open, transparent and widespread debate and discussion has resulted\
  \ in 40 recommendations \u2013 made public on 18 November 2014 \u2013 that were\
  \ discussed and unanimously approved by the full IOC membership at the 127th IOC\
  \ Session on 8 and 9 December 2014 in Monaco. The 40 recommendations that make up\
  \ Olympic Agenda 2020 stem from the thousands of contributions received from members\
  \ of the Olympic Movement, public and civil society. More than 40,000 submissions\
  \ were received, from which 1,200 concrete ideas were produced. These ideas were\
  \ then further refined into the 40 recommendations by the IOC Executive Board, the\
  \ 126 th IOC Session, 14 Working Groups, the IOC Commissions, and  two Olympic Summits.\
  \ In 2021, Olympic Agenda 2020+5, the new strategic roadmap which includes 15 recommendations,\
  \ is the successor of Olympic Agenda 2020. Building on the results of the previous\
  \ roadmap, it will guide the work of the IOC and the Olympic Movement for the next\
  \ five years. The 15 recommendations have been developed through an inclusive and\
  \ collaborative process and are based on key trends that have been identified as\
  \ likely to be decisive in the post-coronavirus world. They are also areas where\
  \ sport and the values of Olympism can play a key role. Learn more : Olympic Agenda\
  \ 2020 Olympic Agenda 2020: 20+20 Recommendations Olympic Agenda 2020: Context and\
  \ Background Olympic Agenda 2020+5"
- What is the New Norm?
- The New Norm is an ambitious set of 118 reforms that reimagines how the Olympic
  Games are delivered. The plan, which focuses on six recommendations of Olympic Agenda
  2020 related to the organisation of the Games, will provide cities with increased
  flexibility in designing the Games to meet long-term development goals, and will
  ensure that host cities receive more assistance from the IOC and the wider Olympic
  Movement. The New Norm has been approved by the IOC members during the 132nd IOC
  Session held in PyeongChang in February 2018. More than 80 of the 118 solutions
  that have been proposed would result in cost efficiencies without compromising the
  Olympic experience. The plan invites opportunities to reduce venue sizes, rethink
  transport options, optimise existing infrastructure and reuse the field of play
  for various sports.
- What measures are taken to fight doping at the Olympic Games?
- "The fight against doping is a priority for the IOC. It works in close collaboration\
  \ with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with an aim to applying a \u201Czero\
  \ tolerance\u201D policy. The IOC\u2019s Medical Commission has been fighting doping\
  \ since 1967. Its field of action expanded after the creation of WADA in 1999. The\
  \ role of this independent Agency is to promote and coordinate, on an international\
  \ level, the fight against all forms of doping. At the Games, the IOC requires the\
  \ Organising Committee to apply all practical methods of collecting urine and blood\
  \ samples. It sets the number of tests to be performed in collaboration with the\
  \ IFs concerned, the Games Organising Committee and the laboratory accredited for\
  \ the Games, which works solely under the authority of the IOC."
- How does the Olympic Movement contribute to the fair development of sport?
- Through Olympic Solidarity, a Commission of the International Olympic Committee
  (IOC), assistance is provided to all of the National Olympic Committees (NOCs),
  particularly to those which are in greater need, so that they can develop their
  own structures to favour the expansion of sport in their countries. World and continental
  programmes are set up to increase global assistance to the athletes, strengthen
  the structure of the NOCs and maintain assistance to training for coaches. Athletes
  can also obtain subsidies to help them train with a view to qualifying for the Olympic
  Games.
- What do the IOC and the Olympic Movement do in the domains of sustainability and
  legacy?
- "The IOC is committed to building a sustainable future by working with partners\
  \ and major groups and driving a global framework for action. Sport presents broad\
  \ opportunities to promote sustainability awareness, capacity building and far-reaching\
  \ actions for environmental, social and economic development across society. As\
  \ the Olympic Games have grown to become the world\u2019s foremost sporting event,\
  \ their impact on a host city and country has also increased. The International\
  \ Olympic Committee (IOC) realised that the Games need to create more than just\
  \ good memories from 16 days of competition. Today sustainability and legacy are\
  \ essential parts of any modern Olympic Games project. These have been increasingly\
  \ important themes since the early 2000s and are central concepts in the Olympic\
  \ Agenda 2020 initiative, the strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement."
- What are the IOC principles on non-discrimination ?
- "Since the foundation of the IOC, non-discrimination has been at the core of the\
  \ Olympic Games. Pierre de Coubertin founder of the modern Olympic Games and the\
  \ IOC once said : \"We shall not have peace until the prejudices that now separate\
  \ the different races are outlived. To attain this end, what better means is there\
  \ than to bring the youth of all countries periodically together for amicable trials\
  \ of muscular strength and agility?\u201D The Olympic Charter now states, in the\
  \ Fundamental Principles of Olympism, that \u201CThe enjoyment of the rights and\
  \ freedoms [...] shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race,\
  \ colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion,\
  \ national or social origin, property, birth or other status\u201D."
- What is the role of the Ethics Commission?
- Its mission is to ensure respect, within the Olympic Movement, of the ethical principles
  set out in the Olympic Charter . To do this, it establishes a Code of Ethics which
  contains the applicable rules. In the event of a violation of the Code, it recommends
  measures to the IOC Executive Board. These range from a reminder of the rules to
  sanctions such as suspension of an NOC. The Ethics Commission also seeks to avoid
  breaches of the Code of Ethics by advising all the members of the Olympic Movement.
  This independent Commission is composed of nine members, the majority of whom are
  personalities from outside the Olympic Movement.
- Who can refer cases to the Ethics Commission?
- Anyone concerned by a violation of the ethical principles in the IOC Code of Ethics
  can make a complaint to the Ethics Commission, provided that the complaint is against
  one of the bodies required to comply with the Code of Ethics - namely the IOC members,
  the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), National Olympic Committees
  (NOCs), the cities bidding to host the Olympic Games and anyone taking part in the
  Olympic Games. The complaint will be sent to the IOC President for analysis and
  a recommendation by the Commission if the situation warrants it.
- "Who is concerned by the Ethics Commission\u2019s recommendations?"
- 'The Ethics Commission can recommend measures or sanctions against people or organisations
  who are required to respect the Olympic Charter and the Code of Ethics: the IOC
  administration and members, the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs),
  the National Olympic Committees (NOCs), the cities bidding to host the Olympic Games
  or Youth Olympic Games and all the Olympic Games participants, including athletes
  and their entourage members, NOC delegations, and the International Federations
  (IFs) and their referees, judges, etc.'
- How can I report suspicious activity related to competition manipulation or an infringement
  of the IOC Code of Ethics?
- You can report suspicious approaches, activities related to competition manipulation,
  infringements of the IOC Code of Ethics or other matters, including financial misconduct
  or other legal, regulatory and ethical breaches over which the IOC has jurisdiction,
  by using the IOC Integrity and Compliance Hotline .
- Can the IOC influence the political system of a country ?
- The IOC is the owner of the Olympic Games and leader of the Olympic Movement. The
  IOC has no mandate and no capability to change the laws or political system of a
  sovereign country. This also guarantees that in return, the IOC can maintain its
  independence, its political neutrality, which it needs to preserve the autonomy
  of sport.
- To what extent can the IOC ensure that the OCOGs comply with human rights requirements
  ?
- "Respect for the Olympic Charter is part of the Olympic Host Contract, and by signing\
  \ the Olympic Host Contract, hosts are committing to respect the Olympic Charter\
  \ in the context of the Games. Important provisions related to respect for human\
  \ rights in the conduct of Games-related activities are also included in the Host\
  \ Contract (e.g. labour conditions and procurement, diversity and inclusion, health\
  \ and environment, media coverage of the Games, peaceful assembly and protest, relocation\
  \ of populations displaced by Olympic constructions, privacy and use of personal\
  \ data). The IOC monitors regularly and holds discussion with the OCOGs to make\
  \ sure they meet their contractual requirements. In addition, the IOC has established\
  \ an escalation mechanism with all Organising Committees through the Coordination\
  \ Commission. All complaints can be brought to the immediate attention of the Organising\
  \ Committee through this process. Other stakeholders can raise their topics with\
  \ the IOC, which will then take them up with the Organising Committee too. However,\
  \ it is important to note that the IOC has neither the mandate nor the capability\
  \ to change the laws or the political system of a sovereign country. This must rightfully\
  \ remain the legitimate role of governments and respective intergovernmental organisations.\
  \ The situation of human rights outside the Olympic Games\u2019 activities is beyond\
  \ the IOC\u2019s remit."
- What measures have been taken to protect human rights during operations related
  to the Games ?
- "The IOC recognises and upholds human rights, as enshrined in both the Fundamental\
  \ Principles of the Olympic Charter and the IOC Code of Ethics. It is committed\
  \ to improving the promotion and respect of human rights within the scope of its\
  \ responsibility across its three spheres of influence \u2013 as an organisation,\
  \ as the owner of the Olympic Games and as the leader of the Olympic Movement. In\
  \ 2017, as part of the implementation of Olympic Agenda 2020, the IOC adopted new\
  \ procedures to ensure that Games-related activities further minimise negative impacts\
  \ on people while maximising positive ones, in order to ensure that respect for\
  \ human rights can become an important dimension of the success of Games. The Olympic\
  \ Host Contract has been strengthened with the inclusion of a dedicated requirement\
  \ for Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) and hosts to \u201Cprotect\
  \ and respect human rights and ensure any violation of human rights is remedied\
  \ in a manner consistent with international agreements, laws and regulations applicable\
  \ in the Host Country and in a manner consistent with all internationally recognised\
  \ human rights standards and principles, including the United Nations Guiding Principles\
  \ on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), applicable in the Host Country\u201D. The\
  \ 2018 \u201COperational Requirements\u201D of the Olympic Games also include stronger\
  \ provisions protecting human rights related to the operations of the Games, and\
  \ require OCOGs to adopt a policy commitment and develop and implement a comprehensive\
  \ human rights strategy that covers all their operations, in close cooperation with\
  \ the host city and country, and all their partners. These requirements apply to\
  \ the hosts from 2024 onwards."
- How does the IOC take into account the respect of human rights in choosing hosts
  ?
- Among other changes, the new approach to electing Olympic hosts strengthens human
  rights requirements towards future hosts of the Olympic Games, in line with Olympic
  Agenda 2020+5. In the Future Host Questionnaire, the Preferred Hosts are required
  to describe how they will seek to identify and address adverse human rights impacts,
  in line with international standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business
  and Human Rights (UNGPs), throughout the lifecycle of the Games. As part of procedure
  leading up to an Olympic host election, the IOC commissions an independent human
  rights review of the context of each proposed Olympic project put forward by an
  Interested Party in Continuous Dialogue to host the Games. This practice began during
  the election process for the Olympic Winter Games 2026.
- "How does the Olympic Host Contract enhance the IOC\u2019s commitment to integrity\
  \ ?"
- By signing the Olympic Host Contract following the election of the host, the IOC
  enters into an agreement with the host National Olympic Committee (NOC), the host
  and the OCOG (which signs at a later date), and requires that they abide by the
  provisions of the Olympic Charter and the IOC Code of Ethics. Pursuant to their
  obligations in their activities related to the Games, they shall prohibit any form
  of discrimination, ensure access to the country for media accredited by the IOC,
  freedom of reporting, freedom of expression, open internet, refrain fraud and corruption,
  etc.
- How is the autonomy of sport guaranteed within the Olympic Movement ?
- "The Olympic Charter stipulates that : - (Chapter 1, Rules 2, Paragraph 5) The IOC\u2019\
  s role is to take action to strengthen the unity of the Olympic Movement, to protect\
  \ its independence, to maintain and promote its political neutrality and to reserve\
  \ the autonomy of sport. - (Chapter 4, Rules 27) NOCs may cooperate with governmental\
  \ bodies however they shall not associate themselves with any activity which would\
  \ be in contradiction with the Olympic Charter. The NOCs must preserve their autonomy\
  \ and resist all pressures of any kind, including but not limited to political,\
  \ legal, religious or economic pressures. The IOC Executive Board may take any appropriate\
  \ decisions for the protection of the Olympic Movement\u2019s neutrality. - (Chapter\
  \ 3, Rules 25) Each IF maintains its independence and autonomy in the governance\
  \ of its sport."
- How are Olympic hosts elected?
- An Olympic host election is the result of a close collaborative partnership between
  the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the potential host, together with
  its National Olympic Committee (NOC), to explore every aspect of the proposed Games
  vision and plan. Cities and regions interested in hosting the Olympic Games should
  reach out first to their NOC, to request its official support. The NOC then makes
  contact with the IOC, which provides support and advice from the early stages. If
  the NOC decides to take the project further, it can send an official letter to the
  IOC in order to enter Continuous Dialogue as an Interested Party. Each NOC can only
  support one official project involving its country. This project could involve one
  or more cities or regions. The host election process is overseen by two Future Host
  Commissions, one for Summer, and one for Winter Games. When it feels a project is
  ready to move to the next stage, the relevant Future Host Commission can recommend
  to the IOC Executive Board (EB) to open a Targeted Dialogue for a specific edition/year
  of the Summer or Winter Olympic Games, with one or more cities or regions. From
  this point the Interested Party is known as a Preferred Host for the Games edition.
  During this process, IOC Members will have a number of opportunities to learn more
  about the project from feasibility reports by the Future Host Commission and presentations
  by the Preferred Host. At the end of the Targeted Dialogue, following a detailed
  report and recommendation by the Future Host Commission, the EB will decide whether
  to propose one or more hosts for election by all IOC members at an IOC Session.
  For transparency, the Commission report and all key documents are published.
- Can any country host the Olympic Games?
- The Olympic Movement is universal. The IOC is open to talking to potential hosts
  from any countries with a National Olympic Committee , at any time, about interest
  in staging the Summer or Winter Olympic Games, or Youth Olympic Games. The IOC can
  advise the NOC and potential host city or region about how to develop their project
  and bring key stakeholders on board. The reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020 and the
  New Norm, which make organising the Olympic Games and applying to host more affordable
  and more fitting to the local context, have encouraged an increase in interest in
  hosting, both from previous Olympic hosts and from new regions.
- When will the next hosts for the Olympic Summer Games and Olympic Winter Games be
  elected?
- Under the new approach to electing Olympic hosts , there is no longer a fixed election
  cycle as in the past. This enables the IOC to adapt to the natural pace of each
  potential host, to bring the right project and partner for the Olympic Games at
  the right time, and to ensure strategic benefit for the Olympic Movement. The timing
  depends on a number of factors, including global events. The next available edition
  of the Olympic Games (Summer Games) is 2036. The election of the host is expected
  to take place after 2025. The election of the host of the Olympic Winter Games 2030
  will take place on a date still to be determined by the IOC Executive Board (EB).
  In December 2022, upon the request of the Future Host Commission for the Olympic
  Winter Games, the EB decided to give Commission more time to study opportunities
  and challenges related to future hosting , such as climate change and the idea of
  rotating the Olympic Winter Games within a pool of climate reliable hosts. There
  was also an exploratory discussion around the possibility of a double award for
  2030 and 2034, but no conclusion was reached. The IOC remains in Continuous Dialogue
  with a number of Interested Parties with well-developed projects to host future
  Olympic Winter Games.
- Which cities or regions are interested in hosting the Olympic Summer or Winter Games?
- Under the new approach to electing Olympic hosts, cities and regions can reach out
  to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at any time to discuss hosting a future
  edition of the Olympic Games, the Olympic Winter Games, or the Youth Olympic Games.
  It is possible for one or several cities or regions to host, to maximise the use
  of existing venues for reasons of sustainability. The first step is an informal
  exchange between the IOC and the city or region and the respective N ational O lympic
  C ommittee (NOC) . If these talks progress positively, the NOC and city or region
  can choose to enter a non-committal Continuous Dialogue with the IOC. This helps
  the potential host to explore and improve its Olympic project, without linking it
  to any specific Games edition or year. The IOC is in Continuous Dialogue and informal
  discussions with a number of Interested Parties and potential hosts for Summer,
  Winter and Youth Olympic Games. The IOC respects the confidentiality of potential
  hosts as they work toward the development of the public and private dimensions of
  their project and so will not comment in detail on any particular proposal or release
  the names of cities, regions or NOCs in discussions about future Olympic hosting
  . Interested Parties may promote their vision or project at national level at any
  time.
- Why not have every edition of the Olympic Games in the same place?
- "Universality is part of the mission of the Olympic Games. This applies not only\
  \ to participation by athletes, but also to organising the Games, so different cultures\
  \ can be represented and more people have the opportunity to participate and attend\
  \ the Games as volunteers and spectators. It was the idea of the founder of the\
  \ modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, that the Games should be 'ambulatory',\
  \ by moving around the globe. Coubertin believed that in this way the Games would\
  \ retain their international character and spread the values of Olympism throughout\
  \ the world. Today\u2019s Games are contextual, adapting to the host region and\
  \ country, so that every edition is different, reflecting cultural, sporting and\
  \ other regional and national interests."
- Are Olympic hosts allowed to build new venues for the Games?
- 'Since the International Olympic Committee (IOC) adopted Olympic Agenda 2020 and
  the New Norm, no infrastructure is required to be built to host the Olympic Games.
  Hosts are encouraged as far as possible to use existing and temporary venues, which
  can be spread over several cities, regions or countries. If any new venues are built,
  these must be planned irrespective of the Games and shown to have a long term legacy
  justification and to be in line with existing development plans, to fit the needs
  of the local population. A recent IOC report called Over 125 years of Olympic venues:
  post-Games use found that 92 percent of the permanent Olympic venues from the 21st
  century, and 85 percent of all permanent venues are still in use today.'
- What are the benefits of hosting the Olympic Games?
- Organising the Summer or Winter Olympic Games enables the host region and country
  to achieve social, environmental and economic tangible and intangible benefits for
  its residents. Olympic hosting also helps the host region and country to work towards
  and even accelerate sustainability goals. The benefits of hosting the Olympic Games
  are contextual to the host city, region and country, and are the result of Games
  stakeholders such as the Organising Committee, the National Olympic Committee, and
  local, regional and national governments, working together on a pre- and post- Games
  plan.
- What is the new approach to electing Olympic hosts?
- "Over a period of many years, starting with the adoption of Olympic Agenda 2020\
  \ in 2014, the IOC has reformed its approach to electing Olympic hosts. The focus\
  \ of today\u2019s approach is sustainability and legacy \u2013 achieving maximum\
  \ benefits for communities living in host regions before, during and after the Games.\
  \ In line with the Olympic Host Contract, from 2030 all Olympic Games must be Climate\
  \ Positive . The IOC\u2019s philosophy is that each edition of the Olympic Games\
  \ should reflect the unique character and needs of its host region(s). The IOC works\
  \ closely with potential hosts to help them to design a vision and Games plan that\
  \ best fit their long term social, sporting, environmental and economic development\
  \ plans. Potential hosts are encouraged as far as possible to use existing or temporary\
  \ venues, even if these are located outside the main hosting region. There is no\
  \ longer a fixed bid cycle for Olympic host elections, and cities and regions interested\
  \ in hosting can reach out to the IOC at any time to open a conversation, without\
  \ making any commitments and using minimal resources."
- What is the Olympic Host Contract ?
- The Olympic Host Contract for up-coming Games (previously named the Host City Contract)
  determines the responsibilities of the National Olympic Committee (NOC), the Organising
  Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG) and the host, concerning the organisation,
  financing and staging of the Olympic Games as well as the contribution of the IOC
  to the success of the Olympic Games (Olympic Charter, Chapter 5 Rules 36). By signing
  the Olympic Host Contract following the election of the host, the IOC enters into
  an agreement with the host National Olympic Committee (NOC), the host and the OCOG
  (which signs at a later date), and requires that they abide by the provisions of
  the Olympic Charter and the IOC Code of Ethics.
- When were the hosts of the next Olympic Games chosen?
- 'Paris 2024: Paris (France) was elected host of the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad
  by a vote at the IOC Session in Lima on 13 September 2017, following an historic
  tripartite agreement between the IOC and the cities of Paris and Los Angeles. Milano-Cortina
  2026: Milano-Cortina (Italy) was elected to host the XXV Olympic Winter Games by
  a vote at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne on 24 June 2019. Los Angeles 2028: Los
  Angeles (USA) was elected host of the Games of the XXXIV Olympiad by a vote at the
  same IOC Session in Lima. Brisbane 2032: Brisbane (Australia) was elected to host
  the Games of the XXXV Olympiad by a vote at the 138th  IOC Session in Tokyo on 21
  July 2021. This was the first host election under the new, flexible approach to
  electing Olympic hosts , which does not set a fixed timeframe for Olympic elections.'
- Who chooses the hosts for the Olympic Games?
- It is the members of the IOC, meeting at their Session, who choose the hosts. Electing
  hosts for the Olympic Games is one of the responsibilities of the Session. A host
  is elected by a majority of the votes cast by secret ballot. Each active member
  has one vote. An IOC member must refrain from voting if the election concerns a
  country where he or she is a national. The honorary members, honour members and
  suspended members are not allowed to vote. If a majority is not achieved in the
  first round of voting, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and a
  further round or rounds of voting are held until a majority is obtained by one candidate.
  The IOC is permanently open to discussions with any cities, regions or countries
  and their National Olympic Committees (NOCs), in any part of the world, who are
  interested in hosting the Games of the Olympiad, the Olympic Winter Games, the Youth
  Olympic Games, or the Winter Youth Olympic Games. The process is overseen by two
  permanent Future Host Commissions, one for summer and one for winter Games. These
  Commissions, comprised of IOC Members and other Olympic Movement stakeholders, make
  recommendations to the IOC Executive Board (EB) regarding possible future hosts.
  The EB decides if any should be put forward for election by the Session.
- What were the results of previous host elections ?
- 'Results of the latest elections (since 1990) are available through the following
  document: Factsheet: Olympic host election results'
- How are the Olympic marketing revenues distributed?
- "The IOC is a non-profit organisation and gives more than 90% of the marketing revenue\
  \ to the organisations belonging to the Olympic Movement, to support the organisation\
  \ of the Olympic Games, the Youth Olympic Games and promote sport around the world.\
  \ It supports them through the provision of products, services, technology, expertise\
  \ and staff deployment or via the funding of facilities to support athletes, including\
  \ sports facilities, athlete accommodation, food and health services. The IOC also\
  \ aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone, and so, every Olympic\
  \ cycle, a substantial portion of the profits from the Games is allocated through\
  \ the National Olympic Committees directly to helping athletes and coaches from\
  \ countries with the greatest financial need, as part of the Olympic Solidarity\
  \ programme. Beyond the Games, the IOC\u2019s funds are also used to finance the\
  \ network of athletes\u2019 commissions across the globe which promotes the empowerment\
  \ of athletes and enables their voices to be heard. For instance, substantial investment\
  \ is made in the anti-doping ecosystem, with 50 per cent of the World Anti-Doping\
  \ Agency\u2019s funding coming directly from the IOC. The IOC retains only 10% of\
  \ Olympic revenue for IOC activities to develop sport and cover the operational\
  \ costs of governing the Olympic Movement."
- "Where does the Olympic Movement\u2019s revenue come from?"
- "All the IOC and Olympic Movement organisations\u2019 revenues come from private\
  \ sources. The Olympic Movement\u2019s revenue comes from various programmes, such\
  \ as the sale of broadcast rights (TV, radio and new media), international and national\
  \ sponsorship and the sale of tickets and licensed products."
- What is the TOP programme?
- "The abbreviation \u201CTOP\u201D stands for \u201CThe Olympic Partner\" programme.\
  \ This is a global sponsorship programme managed by the IOC. Created in 1985, its\
  \ aim is to generate diversified revenue to be shared in equal measure between the\
  \ Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) and the Olympic Movement.\
  \ The TOP programme is established for a duration of four years minimum, corresponding\
  \ to the Olympic quadrennial period."
- How to become a sponsor or a partner for the Olympic Games?
- The Olympic Games are one of the most effective international marketing platforms
  in the world, reaching billions of people in over 200 countries and territories
  throughout the world. There are different levels of marketing and licensing programmes
  linked to the Olympic Games at the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Organising
  Committees of the Olympic Games (OCOG) and the National Olympic Committees (NOCs).
  Under the direction of the IOC, "The Olympic Partner" (TOP) programme is a global
  sponsorship programme created in 1985, whose aim is to generate diversified revenue
  to be shared in equal measure between the OCOGs and the Olympic Movement. The Organising
  Committees (OCOGs) manage their own commercial programmes to support the staging
  of the Games. Contracts are negotiated directly by the OCOG and are generally limited
  to the Olympic quadrennial period. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) manage local
  sponsorship programmes in non-competing categories to the TOP sponsors that support
  their sports development activities and Olympic teams. These sponsorship programmes
  grant Olympic marketing rights within the NOC country or territory only. For more
  information on the latter two, please refer to the local sponsorship programmes
  section. For more precise information on local sponsorship opportunities for the
  upcoming Games, please contact the relevant NOC or OCOG .
- What are the objectives of Olympic marketing?
- "The objectives of the Olympic marketing programmes are: To generate revenue to\
  \ be distributed throughout the entire Olympic Movement \u2013 including the OCOGs,\
  \ the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and their continental associations, the\
  \ International Federations (IFs) and other recognised international sports organisations\
  \ \u2013 and to provide financial support for sport in emerging nations. To build\
  \ on the successful activities developed by each Organising Committee for the Olympic\
  \ Games (OCOG) and thereby eliminate the need to recreate the marketing structure\
  \ with each Olympic Games. To ensure that the Olympic Games can be experienced by\
  \ the maximum number of people throughout the world principally via broadcast coverage.\
  \ To protect and promote the equity that is inherent in the Olympic image and ideals.\
  \ To control and limit the commercialisation of the Olympic Games. To create and\
  \ maintain long-term marketing programmes. To enlist the support of Olympic marketing\
  \ partners in the promotion of the Olympic ideals."
- "What is the IOC\u2019s policy on broadcasting the Olympic Games?"
- "The IOC\u2019s broadcasting policy is based on the Olympic Charter : \u201C The\
  \ IOC takes all necessary steps in order to ensure the fullest coverage by the different\
  \ media and the widest possible audience in the world for the Olympic Games .\u201D\
  \ The IOC owns all the global broadcast rights to the Olympic Games, including via\
  \ television, radio, mobile phones and internet platforms. It is responsible for\
  \ awarding these rights to broadcasters around the world, to ensure the widest possible\
  \ coverage of the Games."
- How are the Olympic Games financed?
- "The budget for the Olympic Games has naturally evolved over time and varies for\
  \ each edition depending on the current context of the host city. However, the basic\
  \ principles of financing the Games remain broadly the same and can be broken down\
  \ into two distinct budgets: The Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG)\
  \ Budget The IOC gives no money to governments, but exclusively to the Organising\
  \ Committees for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and assists the Organising Committees\
  \ in many other ways, including through transfer of knowledge and management of\
  \ the host broadcasting operations. This is mainly privately financed with a large\
  \ contribution from the IOC that comes from its different revenue sources, including\
  \ The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme and the sale of broadcast rights for the Olympic\
  \ Games. The IOC contributes a large part of the finances needed to stage an Olympic\
  \ Games. - Tokyo 2020 \u2013 USD 1.7 billion - Beijing 2022 \u2013 USD 880 million\
  \ - Paris 2024 \u2013 USD 1.7 billion - Milano Cortina 2026 \u2013 USD 925 million\
  \ - Los Angeles 2028 \u2013 USD 1.8 billion The IOC also provides the possibility\
  \ to the Games organisers to commercialise the Olympic rights in their territory\
  \ as well as to manage the ticketing of the event. Another revenue source for the\
  \ local organisers is a national partnership programme. As part of its contribution,\
  \ the IOC pays for the host broadcast operation, Olympic Broadcast Services (OBS),\
  \ and provides various forms of Games support to the OCOG including through its\
  \ \u201CTransfer of Knowledge\u201D programmes. The most recent editions of the\
  \ Olympic Games and Olympic Winter Games have all either broken even or made a profit.\
  \ The Non-OCOG Budget: This budget is generally under the control of the local authorities\
  \ and comprises several elements: Capital Investment budget (Competition and Non-Competition\
  \ venues) - This is directly related to the construction of the permanent competition\
  \ and non-competition venues which must have a long term legacy. The financing of\
  \ such investments are usually undertaken by the public authorities and/or the private\
  \ sector. Operations budget - This includes the operational services of public authorities\
  \ in support of the Games (such as security, transport, medical services, customs\
  \ and immigration, etc.). In addition, each city/region/country has a long-term\
  \ investment plan for general infrastructure which deals with wider infrastructure\
  \ investments that the host country and city are making independently of the Games,\
  \ such as investments in roads, airports and rail ways. How this is funded and the\
  \ scope of this investment plan very much depend on what already exists in the city\
  \ and the long term development vision of the city and country. As per the Olympic\
  \ Host Contract, the IOC requires that all Organising Committees provide annual\
  \ financial statements certified by an independent certified public accountant."
- What is the role of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in organising the
  Olympic Games?
- The IOC entrusts the honour and responsibility of hosting the Games to a host elected
  by the IOC Session. The organisation for the Games is based on a partnership between
  the IOC and the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG). The Olympic Games
  are the exclusive property of the IOC, which is the supreme authority for all matters
  concerning the Games. Its role is to supervise, support and monitor the organisation
  of the Games; ensure that they run smoothly; and make sure that the rules of the
  Olympic Charter and the Olympic Host Contract are respected. It is also the IOC
  that issues the invitation to NOCs to participate.
- Who organises the Olympic Games?
- "The host city\u2019s Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) is in charge\
  \ of organising this great event. When the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\
  \ selects a city to stage the Games, the city and the National Olympic Committee\
  \ (NOC) of the host country create the OCOG which will organise the Games. From\
  \ the moment it is created, seven years before the Games, the OCOG works closely\
  \ with the IOC."
- Who organises the Paralympic Games?
- The Paralympic Games are supervised by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC),
  a body recognised by the IOC. Each edition of the Paralympic Games is under the
  responsibility of an organising committee. They are always held in the same year
  as the Olympic Games. Since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul and the 1992 Winter Games
  in Albertville, the Paralympic Games have been held using the same venues as the
  Olympic Games. Since the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the same organising
  committee has been responsible for staging both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
- What role does the government of a country have in organising the Games ?
- "The three main constituent groups involved in organizing the Games are the International\
  \ Olympic Committee (IOC), the National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and the International\
  \ Sports Federations (IFs), not the government of the host country. While the government\
  \ of the host country has a role to play in supporting the bid of their city in\
  \ hosting the Games, it does not take part in the Olympic Host Contract and does\
  \ not issue the invitations to NOCs to participate. Invitations to the NOCs are\
  \ issued only by the IOC. During the opening ceremony, the Head of State of the\
  \ host country is received at the entrance of the stadium by the IOC President.\
  \ The IOC President then meets the HOS in the official stand. The HOS proclaims\
  \ the Games open by pronouncing the following: - For the Olympic Summer Games: \u201C\
  I declare open the Games of ... (name of City) celebrating the ... Olympiad of the\
  \ modern era.\u201D - For the Olympic Winter Games: \" I declare open the Games\
  \ of ... (name of the host) celebrating the \u2026 (number) Olympic Winter Games.\u201D\
  \ No other politician is allowed to play any role whatsoever, not even during medal\
  \ ceremonies. Except from that, the government shall not interfere with activities\
  \ related to the organization of the Games."
- How do the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies take place?
- "The philosophy and ceremonial aspects which surround the Olympic Games distinguish\
  \ them from all other international sports events. Through music, song, dance and\
  \ fireworks, the opening and closing ceremonies invite people to discover the culture\
  \ of the country in which the Games are taking place. In addition to these celebrations,\
  \ there are some very precise rituals at the ceremonies. It was at the 1920 Games\
  \ in Antwerp that most of this protocol was put in place. It has been developed\
  \ over subsequent editions of the Games. Today, Rule 55 of the Olympic Charter specifies\
  \ some of the protocol that has to be followed during the ceremonies and the words\
  \ used by the head of state of the host country to open the Games. The other main\
  \ points of the opening ceremony are: 1.  Entrance of Head of State and IOC President\
  \ 2.  Playing of the national anthem 3.  The parade of the athletes 4.  The symbolic\
  \ release of doves 5.  Olympic Laurel Award 6.  Official Speeches 7.  Opening of\
  \ the Games 8.  Raising  the  Olympic  flag  and  playing  the  Olympic Anthem 9.\

- What is the Olympic oath and when was it created?
- "Taken for the first time at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp by Victor Boin, a\
  \ Belgian fencer, the Olympic oath is one of the protocol elements of the Opening\
  \ Ceremony. It is taken by an athlete from the host county, on behalf of all the\
  \ athletes. This oath is similar to the one sworn by Olympic athletes in ancient\
  \ times \u2013 the only difference being that today\u2019s athletes take the oath\
  \ with the Olympic flag and not the innards of a sacrificed animal. Since 1972,\
  \ a judge has sworn an oath alongside the athlete at the Games opening ceremony;\
  \ and since 2012, so too has a coach. The first Olympic oath at the Games of the\
  \ modern era was written by Pierre de Coubertin. It has been modified over time\
  \ to reflect the changing nature of sports competitions. In 2000, in Sydney, for\
  \ the first time, the oath explicitly included a reference to doping. Since the\
  \ Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018, the athletes\u2019, officials\u2019 and\
  \ coaches\u2019 oaths have been merged into one to save time during the ceremony.\
  \ At the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the number of oath-takers will be extended from\
  \ three to six \u2013 two athletes, two coaches and two judges. Each representative\
  \ says their own part: \u201CIn the name of the athletes\u201D, \u201CIn the name\
  \ of all judges\u201D or \u201CIn the name of all the coaches and officials\u201D\
  . Then the athlete recites on behalf of all three categories: \u201C\u2026 we promise\
  \ to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in\
  \ the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality. Together we stand in solidarity\
  \ and commit ourselves to sport without doping, without cheating, without any form\
  \ of discrimination. We do this for the honour of our teams, in respect for the\
  \ Fundamental Principles of Olympism, and to make the world a better place through\
  \ sport.\u201D"
- Why does an athlete take the oath at the Olympic Games?
- "When an athlete takes the Olympic oath at the opening ceremony, he/she commits,\
  \ on behalf of all the other competitors, to respect the rules and take part the\
  \ competitions in a spirit of fair play. The reciting of the Olympic oath by an\
  \ athlete has been one of the protocol elements of the opening ceremony since the\
  \ 1920 Games in Antwerp. The text, originally written by Pierre de Coubertin, has\
  \ since evolved. Since t he 2000 Games in Sydney, it has included a sentence committing\
  \ to sport without doping. These days, as well as on behalf of the athletes, the\
  \ Olympic oath is taken on behalf of the officials and coaches. At the Olympic Games\
  \ Tokyo 2020, the number of oath-takers is extended from three to six \u2013 two\
  \ athletes, two coaches and two judges. This is in line with the IOC\u2019s and\
  \ the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee\u2019s drive towards gender equality as it\
  \ enables full gender balance amongst those taking the oath on behalf of all Games\
  \ participants. Learn more: Factsheet: The Opening Ceremony of the Games of the\

- Who was Pierre de Coubertin?
- "Baron Pierre de Coubertin was the founder of the modern Olympic Games. Inspired\
  \ by the ancient Olympic Games held in Olympia, Greece, which ended in 393 AD, Frenchman\
  \ Pierre de Coubertin decided to pursue his project to revive the Olympic Games.\
  \ A man who devoted his life to education, history and sociology, in 1894 he founded\
  \ the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to help build a peaceful and better\
  \ world by educating young people through sport. The first Olympic Games of the\
  \ modern era were held in 1896 in Athens. Born in Paris in 1863, Pierre de Fr\xE9\
  dy, Baron de Coubertin, came from an aristocratic family. He was a very keen sportsman,\
  \ who enjoyed boxing, fencing, horse-riding and rowing. He firmly believed that\
  \ sport was the key to developing mental energy. He was behind the creation of the\
  \ five-ring Olympic symbol in 1913, the Olympic Charter and protocol, the athletes\u2019\
  \ oath and the main components of the Games opening and closing ceremonies. It was\
  \ also he who said: \u201C The important thing in life is not the triumph but the\
  \ fight; the essential thing is not to have won, but to have fought well .\u201D\
  \ Between 1896 and 1925, he was IOC President. He died in Geneva, Switzerland, on\
  \ 2 September 1937. In accordance with his last wishes, his heart was laid to rest\
  \ in Olympia, Greece, in the marble stele which commemorates the revival of the\
  \ Olympic Games."
- What is the origin of the Olympic Games?
- "The history of the Games goes back around 3,000 years, to the Peloponnese in Ancient\
  \ Greece. Sports contests organised at Olympia took place every four years and acquired\
  \ the name Olympic Games. We do not know exactly when they started, but the date\
  \ of 776 BC is often cited in written sources. The exact reasons for the birth of\
  \ the Games are still unknown, as history has become mixed up with mythology. The\
  \ four-year interval between the Ancient Games editions was named an \u201COlympiad\u201D\
  , and was used for dating purposes at the time: time was counted in Olympiads rather\
  \ than years. In 1894, Pierre de Coubertin launched his plan to revive the Olympic\
  \ Games, and in 1896 the first Games of the modern era were held in Athens."
- When did women first compete in the Olympic Games?
- "Women competed for the first time at the 1900 Games in Paris. Of a total of 997\
  \ athletes, 22 women competed in five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism\
  \ and golf. The IOC is committed to gender equality in sport. The Olympic Charter,\
  \ Chapitre 1, Rule 2.8 , states that the IOC's role is: \u201C to encourage and\
  \ support the promotion of women in sport at all levels and in all structures with\
  \ a view to implementing the principle of equality of men and women .\u201D With\
  \ the addition of women\u2019s boxing to the Olympic programme, the 2012 Games in\
  \ London were the first in which women competed in all the sports on the programme.\
  \ Since 1991, any new sport seeking to join the Olympic programme must have women\u2019\
  s competitions. At the 2016 Games in Rio, 45 per cent of the participants were women.\

- When were the first Olympic Winter Games held?
- "The first Winter Games were held in Chamonix (France), in 1924. Initially called\
  \ the \u201CInternational Winter Sports Week\u201D, this event was renamed the \u201C\
  1st Olympic Winter Games\u201D only in 1926 at the IOC Session in Lisbon. The decision\
  \ to create a separate Winter Games cycle was taken at the 1925 IOC Session in Prague.\

- Which sports were on the programme of the ancient Olympic Games?
- 'At the time, the programme featured only individual events: running, boxing, wrestling,
  pankration, equestrianism, and the pentathlon (running, discus, javelin, long jump,
  wrestling).'
- Since when have the Summer and Winter Games no longer been held in the same year?
- At its 1986 Session in Lausanne, the IOC decided to introduce this change. From
  1924 to 1992, the Summer and Winter Games were each held in the same year, every
  four years. This four years period is called "Olympiad". The last Summer and Winter
  Games held in the same year were in Barcelona (Summer) and Albertville (Winter)
  in 1992. Since then, the Summer and Winter Games are each still held every four
  years but the Summer Games are celebrated during the first year of an Olympiad and
  the Winter Games held in the third year.
- Why are the Olympic Games held every four years?
- "To respect the ancient origins of the Olympic Games, which were held every four\
  \ years at Olympia. The four-year interval between the Ancient Games editions was\
  \ named an \u201COlympiad\u201D, and was used for dating purposes at the time: time\
  \ was counted in Olympiads rather than years. In 1894, Pierre de Coubertin launched\
  \ his plan to revive the Olympic Games, and in 1896 the first Games of the modern\
  \ era were held in Athens. Today, an Olympiad begins on the first of January of\
  \ the first year and ends on the thirty-first of December of the fourth year. Learn\

- Why does the International Olympic Committee have its headquarters in Lausanne,
  Switzerland?
- The IOC headquarters have been in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva, since
  1915. It was Pierre de Coubertin who chose this city. He explained later that not
  only did he see Lausanne as an ideal location for the administrative headquarters,
  but also that in the midst of the First World War the city could offer the stability
  that had become essential for Olympism.
