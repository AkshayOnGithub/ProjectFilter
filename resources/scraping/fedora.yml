- 'We target the following broad sets of users:'
- Where can I obtain Fedora? Can I redistribute Fedora or make derivatives from it?
- You can download, use and redistribute Fedora and we strongly encourage you to do
  so. The Free and open source licenses (such as the GPL) governing the source code
  allow you to redistribute or modify Fedora but any use must comply with the Fedora
  Trademark Guidelines . Details are available at
- Is my hardware compatible with Fedora?
- 'Linux is able to support every class of component and peripheral. Fedora includes
  all of the drivers provided by the projects that are responsible for Linux hardware
  support. The Fedora installation process automatically detects the supported hardware
  on your computer.

  Some specific models of hardware are not yet supported under Linux, or require proprietary
  drivers from the manufacturer. If Fedora does not automatically detect a device,
  you may need to install additional drivers or firmware.'

- 'Fedora provides a very user-friendly installation system, with both graphical and
  text interfaces. Read the Fedora Installation Guide in Documentation Project or
  Quick Install Guide in the wiki for step by step details:'
- How do I configure network connections? How does Fedora support wireless connections?
- 'By default, Fedora configures the network cards on your computer to automatically
  obtain the correct network settings with DHCP. If your computer connects to a wired
  network or DSL router, no further configuration action is required.

  For other types of connections, you can use  Network Manager  which is installed
  and enabled by default in Fedora. This new system provides automatic networking
  and wireless configuration, as well as an interface for VPN connections. Laptops
  may switch seamlessly between networks with NetworkManager. Refer to the System
  Administrator''s Guide at docs.fedoraproject.org.

  Also refer to the Fedora Wireless Guide at docs.fedoraproject.org to learn more
  about wireless, and its implementation in Fedora.'
- How do I install new software on Fedora? Is there anything like APT?
- 'The command line dnf utility helps you manage the software on your system.  The
  dnf utility accesses Web sites, known as repositories, to download and install the
  latest versions of software packages.  Fedora systems also include a graphical interface
  to dnf,  which appears on the Main Menu under Applications > Add/Remove Software.
  With Gnome as the default interface, a new graphical tool dnfdragora is available.
  The dnfdragora tool is available for the command line and is invokeda with sudo
  dnfdragora.

  Fedora currently includes over 15 000 packages.

  Refer to this page for more information about dnf:'
- How do I keep Fedora systems updated?
- 'Fedora includes PackageKit that provides desktop notifications to automatically
  inform you whenever updates are available. To perform a system update manually on
  Fedora, select System > Administration > Update System. This utility updates all
  of your system''s software that is provided by dnf repositories.

  To start a full system update from the command-line, enter the following at the
  prompt:'
- Can Fedora update itself automatically?

- Why doesn't Fedora include support for proprietary formats like MP3 or MPEG?
- 'The MP3 and MPEG formats are covered by patents, and the patent owners have not
  released the technologies under licenses which are compatible with Fedora''s requirements.

  As of 2017, the patents for MP3 and MPEG have expired. These codecs are currently
  included within Fedora.

  Fedora only supports and includes free and open source software.  Technologies under
  stringent copyright or patent restrictions are not included in Fedora.  For more
  information about multimedia support in Fedora, including more about MP3 and MPEG
  support, see the Multimedia section:'
- Why doesn't Fedora include DVD video playback support?
- 'The DVD video formats are covered by patents, and the patent owners have not released
  the technologies under licenses which are compatible with Fedora''s requirements.  Many
  DVD videos also use a copy protection technology, and the code necessary to play
  those videos may violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a copyright
  law of the United States.

  Fedora only supports and includes free and open source software.  Technologies under
  stringent copyright or patent restrictions are not included in Fedora.  For more
  information about multimedia support in Fedora, including more about DVD video support,

  page:'
- Does Fedora include Java?
- 'Yes. Fedora includes OpenJDK which is Sun Java under a free and open source license.
  Please refer to our JavaFAQ  page for information regarding Java and Fedora:'
- What is SELinux, and where can I read more about it?
- 'Fedora is the first mainstream operating system in the world to provide a Mandatory
  Access Control (MAC) security system by default, using the SELinux framework.  The
  SELinux configuration included in Fedora provides enhanced security by restricting
  the actions of processes running on a Fedora system. Being restricted to certain
  privileges/actions drastically reduces the impact of security vulnerabilities. These
  programs, processes or services are fenced-in with no access allowed outside their
  registered rights.

  SELinux in Fedora, also has a ''strict'' policy, which is useful for very security-sensitive
  environments. There are other security ssub-systems enabled through the SELinux
  framework, such as MLS, MCS and RBAC.

  Refer to the following document for more information on the SELinux implementation
  in Fedora:'
- What is Virtualization? Where can I learn about using it?
- 'Fedora includes extensive support for virtualization. This enables multiple operating
  systems to run simultaneously on the same machine with little reduction in overall
  performance. Each operating system is allocated some of the resources of the host
  computer. Administrators may also move a running operating system between machines
  without disrupting or shutting down services.

  The Virtualization page can help you get started.'
- When is the next release of Fedora? What is the release schedule?
- See the  Fedora Project Releases Schedule page.
- How long is each release of Fedora maintained?
- 'Fedora Project maintains any particular release of Fedora for a month after two
  subsequent releases. The Fedora release lifecycle is explained in more detail:'
- Where can I find information on Fedora security updates?
- See  Fedora Security Advisories page.
- What is the errata or updates policy for The Fedora Project?
- 'Security updates, bugfix updates, and new feature updates will all be available,
  through Red Hat and third parties. Updates may be staged (first made available for
  public qualification, then later for general consumption) when appropriate. In drastic
  cases, we may remove a package from The Fedora Project if we judge that a necessary
  security update is too problematic/disruptive to the larger goals of the project.
  Availability of updates should not be misconstrued as support for anything other
  than continued development and innovation of the code base. Some updates that are
  too disruptive to include in a general release will be made available only in the
  development branch and included in the subsequent general release. Merely continuing
  to update won''t lead to a next release and you need to explicitly do a distribution
  upgrade if desired. Updates are available for every release for the period denoted
  in the LifeCycle page.

  Red Hat will not be providing an SLA (Service Level Agreement) for resolution times
  for updates for The Fedora Project. Security updates will take priority. For packages
  maintained by external parties, Red Hat may respond to security holes by deprecating
  packages if the external maintainers do not provide updates in a reasonable time.
  Users who want support, or maintenance according to an SLA, may purchase the appropriate
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux product for their use.'
- I have a pre-release version of Fedora. Can I upgrade to the final release?
- Yes. Refer to Upgrading from pre-release to final for details.
- I have an older Fedora release.  Can I upgrade my existing installation?
- 'Yes. For more information on upgrading options, refer to the DistributionUpgrades
  page:'
- Where can I find help?
- 'You can find documentation and get help through forums, IRC, or mailing lists from
  others in the Fedora community.  See the Communicate  page for more information:

  Please do not contact Fedora developers directly, or use the special developer channels,
  for end-user support.  The developers are very busy writing and maintaining Fedora
  software and do not have much spare time for these issues.'
- I hear all of these terms that are unfamiliar, what do they mean?
- For definitions to many of the most common terms, refer to the   Glossary .
- Where can I report bugs or request features for software packages existing in Fedora?
- Refer to the BugsAndFeatureRequests page for guidance on this.
- Where I can learn more about security features and status in Fedora? How do I report
  a security bug?
- Refer to the Security  page for all of this information.
- I'm experiencing a problem, and I think it might be my hardware.  Where should I
  look?
- Check the HardwareProblems page before posting bugs that might be known hardware
  problems.
- Where can I request a newer version of a package in Fedora?
- File a request in http://bugzilla.redhat.com against the particular package you
  would like to have a update. Providing more details on why you want that particular
  update would be useful information for the package maintainers.
- I have a question that isn't in this list.  Where else can I find help?
- See the links for   Fedora Resources  at the bottom of this page.
- Can I donate to the Fedora Project?
- Yes, you can donate your time to Fedora Project by contributing to Fedora, or to
  free and open source software in general. You can also donate money but that requires
  a bit more creativity! Refer to Contribute for more details.
- What is Fedora?
- 'Fedora is a Linux-based operating system that showcases the latest in free and
  open source software. Fedora is always free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
  It is built by people across the globe who work together as a community: the Fedora
  Project. The Fedora Project is open and anyone is welcome to join. The Fedora Project
  is out front for you, leading the advancement of free, open software and content.

  Refer also to the Overview page.'
- What are the objectives of Fedora?
- ''
- Why a project instead of a product?
- A global steering committee at Red Hat decided that Red Hat Linux was suffering
  from too many compromises as a retail product, and that the company should redirect
  efforts toward creating a community-based project. Rather than being subject to
  retail product delivery schedules, Fedora is released on schedules set by a decision-making
  process that is open, and influenced by the community.
- What are the primary benefits of this change?
- 'Changing the product to a project:'
- Will Red Hat provide formal technical support for The Fedora Project?
- No, no formal Web or phone support for The Fedora Project will be available from
  Red Hat. Red Hat's supported product line will be based in part on a recent release
  of Fedora, and our development will be done externally as part of The Fedora Project
  as much as possible.
- How will The Fedora Project be made available to the public?
- Fedora releases will be available as ISO images for both CDs and DVDs, and will
  also be available through other channels such as third-party online sales of physical
  media; distribution at Linux User Groups, included in magazines and in books, and
  maybe even handed out at trade shows. The bits may be actively pushed into content
  sharing networks such as BitTorrent. (Not all mechanisms will be used for each release,
  except that ISOs will be freely available for each release.)
- Will Fedora be sold in retail?
- "Fedora will not be sold through the retail channel as a shrinkwrapped box. There\
  \ is no list price for Fedora. The rapid development pace we expect for Fedora doesn't\
  \ suit retail distribution \u2014 it is a lot of work to get a box product in and\
  \ out of the channel, and retail isn't set up to efficiently handle software that\
  \ is updated as often as every six months. Also, the creation of packaging and other\
  \ materials that are necessary for retail significantly slows down the time to market,\
  \ which means that users can't get the freshest bits when they are still truly fresh.\
  \ Further information on Red Hat's retail product line is available at the Red Hat\
  \ website."
- What is the difference between "Fedora distribution", "The Fedora Project", and
  "Fedora"?
- The Fedora Project is a collection of sub-projects.  The Fedora distribution is
  the central project, which aims to provide a platform with the best in free and
  open source software.  Fedora generally refers to the Fedora Project as a whole.
  Sometimes Fedora is used to refer to a collection of software from the Fedora Project
  or a system running Fedora software, but we prefer to refer to these with either
  specific names like Fedora Workstation, Fedora CoreOS, etc., or as Fedora Linux.
- Whom can I contact in the individual Fedora sub-projects?
- Try the project's mailing list first, which gives the project leads and other community
  members the chance to help you.  You can find information for the various projects
  on the Communicate  page.
- How is the Fedora Project organized and governed?
- 'The Fedora Project is managed by the Fedora Council, which consists of elected
  community members, meritocratic appointments from different areas of the project,
  and positions appointed by Red Hat.

  The Fedora Project is a collection of many smaller   projects , working together
  to produce the platform and build the supporting community.  These different sub-projects
  are independent of one another, but work together to achieve common goals and coordinate
  efforts.

  Each of the sub-projects has leads or a steering committee to organize and guide
  that project''s development.  The Fedora Project operates as a meritocracy , where
  responsibility and power are granted based upon ability and effort.  The people
  who lead Fedora are selected because they have proven they are willing and able
  to do so.'
- What kind of project management method does each Fedora sub-project use?
- 'Each project has either leads or a Steering Committee to guide it.  Individual
  contributors are given a great deal of freedom to work on whatever they choose,
  but they are asked to follow the guidance from the project''s committee for processes
  and approval for new initiatives.

  Like other responsibilities in the Fedora Project, committee membership is based
  largely upon merit, but all voices are welcome, and new ideas and opinions will
  be given due attention.  Innovating and leading new ideas is a great way to earn
  recognition within the community.

  Contributors can join committee members in regular IRC meetings.  The meetings are
  open, and minutes are made publicly available and usually posted to the appropriate
  mailing list.  Raw IRC logs are also sometimes available.

  Most sub-projects keep a schedule of tasks on this wiki.  Check the Projects  page
  for links to individual sub-project pages.  From those individual pages, you can
  find all of the available information for that project.'
- Does the Fedora Project assign tasks to contributors, or do the contributors decide
  what to do?
- Interested volunteers are encouraged to take up the tasks they would like to contribute
  towards. You can avoid redundant tasks by posting to the relevant project list and
  coordinating with other interested community members. If you're not sure where you
  want to contribute, see the   join  page for different areas that can use your help.
  The   Fedora Mentors  project can guide you if you need further help.
- Is there a partnership program between schools or non-profits and Fedora?
- Not at present.  If you have any ideas or suggestions to create such a program,
  please bring it to the attention of   Fedora Marketing .  Interested schools and
  non-profits are welcome to join us for discussions.
- Is there a partnership program between LUGs and Fedora?
- We attempt to work with Linux User Groups in whatever ways we can.  Our list of
  LUG contacts is on our LinuxUserGroups page.  If you would like to represent your
  LUG, please add your LUG to that list.  We also encourage our Ambassadors to engage
  their local LUGs.
- Can schools and non-profits reference the "Fedora Project" name and other Fedora
  marks if they are interacting with the Fedora community?
- Yes, as long as they make it clear whether or not they are representing the Project.  If
  they would like to represent the Project, they can approach and coordinate with
  the   Fedora Marketing  team.  This and other uses of Fedora marks are subject to
  the terms of the   Trademark Guidelines .
- Is there a certification program for third-party applications running on Fedora?
- 'No. The Fedora Project is dedicated to providing the best in free and open source
  software. Fedora leads in open solutions, and is developed with a rapid release
  cycle. Fedora Package Collection allows a vast array of additional Free and open
  source solutions to be contributed by the community and maintained for Fedora. Beyond
  these projects, the Fedora Project does not certify any third-party applications.

  Formal ISV certification is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which shares
  many of Fedora''s features, but is provided on a longer release cycle and is commercially
  supported for 7 years.'
- Is there a certification program for hardware that works with Fedora?
- 'Fedora runs on a large variety of hardware, and the list of working hardware is
  constantly growing larger.  Because Fedora improvements occur very rapidly and consistently,
  including hardware support, a   Hardware Compatibility List  was deemed too time-consuming
  and not worthwhile.  Alternative methods of tracking working hardware have been
  suggested, but the consensus is that manually maintaining a complete list is unfeasible.

  We are collecting hardware information directly from the users anonymously in a
  opt-in method, through the smolt  project. We are always trying to find ways to
  improve Fedora''s hardware support, and welcome constructive feedback.'
- Is the Fedora Project independent of Red Hat, Inc.?
- The Fedora Project is a community project, separate from Red Hat, but Red Hat sponsors
  the Fedora Project and provides a great deal of valuable management and resources
  to the Fedora Project.  Red Hat uses the material that the Fedora Project produces
  to develop its enterprise platform offerings.  Red Hat has a strong interest in
  Fedora, and the success of the Fedora Project has been thanks to the great contributions
  of Red Hat.
- "What is the difference between Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux\_?"
- 'Fedora has the latest and greatest software and new releases every six months.
  Fedora is the upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  has a conservative release and update cycle and is commercially supported by Red
  Hat.

  Refer to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for more details.'
- Why does the tag in my packages say "fc"?
- '"fc" used to denote "Fedora Core.  However after the Fedora 7 release, it has been
  retroactively renamed to "Fedora Collection" along the lines of GCC which is now
  "GNU Compiler Collection".  From the perspective of version comparisons in RPM,
  it was easier to adopt a new meaning for c rather than dropping it simply because
  it refers to the old Core appellation.'
- Why should I help?
- 'Your name in lights, an online CV, and maybe a trip to a FUDCon.

  First, contribute to Fedora and you may get your name in the distribution.  Hey,
  fair is fair.

  Second, if you''re a Fedora contributor, you don''t need a fancy resume; you can
  just tell potential employers to ''Google'' your name.

  Third, top Fedora contributors can receive travel stipends to attend the Fedora
  Users and Developers Conference nearest them.  You will have the opportunity to
  meet some of the giants of the open source movement in person, as their peers and
  equals.

  And last, you''d be playing with this stuff anyway.  Spend your time doing stuff
  that you will enjoy and that others will use.  What more incentive do you need?  Join
  us.'
